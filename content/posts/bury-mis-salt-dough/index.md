# Gathering Crew
Every good plan starts with an idea and a good crew, doesn't it? The sault dough workshops began exactly like this. At the beginning, someone came with a thought of creating something original for Świętnica which ends holiday. Another individual suggested sault dough as it is one of these kids-love-playing-with magical substances that leaves a lot of space for imagination (and mess, but who cares?). Idea was there, but we needed people to make it real. 

I and a bunch of other people declared our willingness to participate in the event. Also, on of the participants called all parents of Bury Miś charges and invite them to the worshops we planned. Some said their children would be delioghted to engage and some even wanted to come by themselves. I wrote a message to parents of each of my charges (Adam, Piotr, and Marcin), but only Marcin could come. Great! We had all that was needed to start our project.

# Workshops
It's been a while since it happened, but I think it's still wort mentioning. Workshops took place during the winter brake, more specifically, at the very end. We spent in Misiówka (the headquarters of Bury Miś in Poznań) around 3 hours wrinkling, crumpling, and cutting the salt dough to make it look nice. Indeed, it was a daunting task, but we managed to process the entire dough.

However, there was something left. Have you ever seen how dry salt dough looks like? Not very esthethically pleasing, I would say. Fortunately, there's a way to solve this problem - dyes. Dry salt dough is perfect for painting.

# Scouts' ball
You may wonder where the title comes from. Well, while the doug was getting dry and rigid, the propositon to attend a ball organized by Poznań division of scouts arrived. It was tightly packed time when it comes to school work, so I couldn't afford spending 3 to 4 hours on two activities. But what if we could combine them? This was the quation I posed to the organizators regarding painting the dough. This way, we could have some fun and do some "real" work at the same time.

To my relief, I received a permission. I took advantage of that and enjoyed the time with my and other people's charges as well as did my job and painted the dough (with the help of others - I even managed to engage scouts).

# Some closing thoughts
All in all, the project was as interesting as it was unexpected. I love to participate in activities I haven't tried before. It was a surprising mix of imagination, planning and joy. I liked it very much. Moreover, I had a chance to share my thoughts in the article in the monthly "Szuflada" by Bury Miś Foundation. Go and check it out by yourself (I'll add a PDF as soon as I get it)!
