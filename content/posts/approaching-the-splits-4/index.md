# Warm up
I've started replacing dump cover pictures of me doing the splits. The exact reasons are not important. But it's not why you're here so let's go straight to the point.

Just one thing... Pictures in this section were taken during only one stretching section. You now [the reason](/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits-2/#excuse), but I just wanted to let you know. They are representative though, so they should suffice. Now, let's see what's up, at last.

# Mystery injury
Recall from the previous blog post about doing the splits that I complained about [the pain I felt in my thigh while stretching](/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits-3/#muscles-extension). It was really odd, like really. The funny thing is that the story gets even weirder as the pain disappeared as suddenly as it started. One day it was annoying me and some other day it just vanished, it ceased to exist. I mean, I fell relieved as hell, but it still is in my head. Biology is a freaking mystery.

Putting that aside, I still experience the consequences of this "injury." Despite not feeling discomfort anymore, my left leg lost some of its flexibility. However, it's building up once again rather quickly so that's good. It's just that I'm a bit paranoid about this situation, but it's okay. I'll manage.

# Kinder surprise inside
I don't know if such an idiom exists, but you get the idea.

Anyway, I'd like to tell you how much I progressed from the last time. Well, I'm veeeery close to finally doing the women's splits, especially on my right side (for left side see the previous section.) I sincerely makes my happy. However, I enjoy it even more because I reviewed photos from my previous posts and I see that I'm actually getting somewhere. That's awesome!

As for the men's splits, it's also okay. I'm not that close, but there's more space. What I don't like though is that I need to warm up to go that deep. When my body is not sufficiently prepared I can't even go as half deep as I can after a warm-up. I have no clue what's going on and I don't like it at all. I fell kind of embarrassed to be honest. You know, I try so hard to improve my flexibility in day-to-day situations and it's not working. I don't know, maybe one day...

# Cheering up
This reflection got depressing at the end. I didn't intend it to go that way because I'm, nonetheless, happy with what I have achieved. I started stretching seriously once again when I enrolled in high school and now I'm way better at this when I was back then. That's really uplifting and I am sure it will be even better. Just practice and practice!

As a sidenote, I'm considering a new series of blog posts dedicated to stretching. It's because I have been extending my spine flexibility for the past two months. My goal is to do a position, which English name I don't know, but it looks like this:

{{< figure src="./images/marmaid.jpg" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="I wish I could do it, but I'm working on it!!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: white;" >}}

And I'm trying to do it.
