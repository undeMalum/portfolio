# Heated debate
The atmosphere during Valentine's Day contrasts with the hustle and stress often associated with holidays like Christmas. While Christmas can be hectic with many people rushing around, Valentine's tends to bring a sense of relief as couples focus on each other's happiness rather than external pressures like politics or economics.

Although this perspective isn't based on extensive research and individual experiences may vary, it reflects a different attitude towards Valentine's compared to other holidays.

Setting aside this observation, I personally enjoy Valentine's Day, especially when I have someone special to share it with. This year, I was fortunate to have a loved one by my side. Our time together encompasses various dimensions, including the freedom to express ourselves artistically. My partner suggested painting as a Valentine's activity after seeing a similar idea on TikTok, and I eagerly agreed, sparking the idea for our Valentine's painting session.

# Labor division
The idea of being a couple involves working together, which sets the stage for how we divided responsibilities for our Valentine's painting session. 

When I asked my girlfriend what we needed to prepare, she suggested snacks and painting supplies, with the paints already on hand from her previous work. I agreed and inquired about what I needed to provide. She expressed interest in purchasing snacks, leaving me responsible for acquiring the painting supports. And that was the extent of our planning.

# Grand day
Finally, on the 14th of February, we were ready to bring our plan to life... well, almost. First, we had to assemble the LEGO roses I got for my girlfriend, which took some time and energy. By the time we finished, we were a bit too tired to start painting, so we decided to postpone it to the next day.

On the 15th of February, still in the Valentine's mood, we finally began our painting adventure in the evening. It was a bit of a struggle at times, but we managed to push through. Okay, that sounds weird, why did I say that?

Maybe because my painting skills aren't great...? My original idea was to create a gradient effect, with a bright yellow center fading into almost black edges. However, the execution didn't quite match the vision. Instead of a spark of hope, it turned into a bit of a disaster. My attempts to salvage it with stars and dots only made matters worse. In the end, it was a mess of yellow, white, and blue lines that didn't quite convey the message I intended.

Meanwhile, my girlfriend's painting turned out amazing! She depicted a moonlit scene with us sitting on the moon beneath a beautiful blue sky filled with stars. It's not just visually stunning but also incredibly sweet.

# Reflection
Despite my painting turning out to be less than stellar, I thoroughly enjoyed the process. It was filled with laughter and quality time spent with my girlfriend. Moreover, it offered me a chance to explore a new creative outlet since I haven't painted since primary school, which feels like ages ago (especially considering it's been around 6 years, which is nearly a third of my life!). Overall, I cherished this experience and look forward to more in the future.

See you next time!
