# Poznański Wolontariusz Roku
[Poznański Wolontariusz Roku](https://www.poznan.pl/mim/main/-,p,16057,35134.html) (Poznań Volunteer of the Year) is a yearly competition that appreciates and rewards those who dedicate a large of chunk of their lives to the volunteer work. The laureates are chosen by the competition jury. There are six categories:

- **youth**: for individuals below the age of 19
- **individual**: for individuals between the ages of 19 and 60
- **senior**: for individuals above the age of 60
- **group**: for groups conducting volunteer activities
- **school volunteering**: for teams operating within school volunteer circles
- **employee volunteering**: for employee volunteering programs

I was, of course, in the first group.

However, the beauty of this competition is that it is not you who sign up. but others who put you in for it. I was lucky enough to have a dedicated CAS Coordinator without whom I wouldn't even know about this enterprise and who putter me in!

That's how the story began in a nutshell.

# Workshops
Nevertheless, before the leaureats were announced on December 7<sup>th</sup>, workshops were organized a day before for different age groups. I took part in those workshops because I said to my self, "why not?" And it was a great decision!

I arrived almost an hour before the registration started so I had plenty of time. I turned out to be a very beneficial experience since many volunteer organizations were there to show what they're doing and offer themselves this way.
