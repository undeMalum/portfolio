# My youtube channel has just started! 
Well, maybe not so `recently`, but still - there it is and **it waits to be discovered by you!** There are already `some videos` (can be viewed also on other pages of this website). Nothing special, but the purpose is to **share a bit of my life** and **the goal is being achieved** (gradually)!

**What shall these pieces cover?** Basically, it's `everything` I do in my life and is `worth reporting` somehow. For instance, it may be me `playing football`, `juggling` or `reflecting` of what I've done. Kinda random, **but works**.

[Here is a quick reference to my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaFx3UdgaiBVbJQBZsR9x-Q). And there is my first viedo! **Enjoy:**
