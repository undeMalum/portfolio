# A simple catch-up
As I underlined in the description of this beautiful blog post, an ongoing commitment to an activity earns you respect and trust. In the life of mine, the most resonating and continous pastime is meeting my lovely charges. Therefore, it is unfortunate that my bulging holiday schedule made those meetings impossible. 

Nevertheless, school year has been bringing me to Poznań every day of the workweek, which obviously facilities commuting to my charges and turns me into their frequent visitor - not all of them, much to my dissapointment, but more on this later.

# Adam
Meeting Adam usually meant I got to ride a bike or play football, but since man proposes and God disposes, the weather ruined the prospect of any outdoor activity. Nevertheless, we had a chance to enjoy sport inside, watching Polish volleyball national team during [the 2023 European Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Men%27s_European_Volleyball_Championship) and [Lech Poznań](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=lech+poznań+jagiellonia&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11v0tlk5w1;2;/m/09nw6c;dt;fp;1;;;) figthing Jagiellonia Białystok.

Moreover, we played Adam's new game - [NBA 2K23](https://nba.2k.com/2k23/). I thought it'd like FIFA by EA, just in basketball. SPOILER - it wasn't and Adam beated me (I'm lame I know :sob:). I guess I need more practice before I move to the US (hopefully.)
