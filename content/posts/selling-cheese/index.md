# A Short Story About Bury Miś And Cheese
Seemingly, Bury Miś Foundation is only a typical organization where enthusiastic volunteers attempt to make the life of the disadvantaged more enjoyable. Indeed, it provides social interaction and support to people who are in strong need of others and struggle to develop bonds with the society, which is worthy of admiration. However, what does differ Bury Miś Foundation from other alike organizations is its complexity. It does not mean that Bury Miś is more relevant because of that. I just want to emphasize my astonishment when I discovered how many activities I can undertake and hence how much I can learn. No matter what it is, whether meeting with charges, being counselor or writing articles - they all are new, exciting and teach me a lot. I especially appreciate selling cheese - not only is it interesting for me, but also proves the self-sufficiency of the charity and fantastically incorporates into its day-to-day life.

[Selling hand-made Kashubian cheese](https://buremisie.org.pl/produkty-z-osady/) constitutes a vital part of the budget. Even though the charity food truck (called MiśTruck by combining words miś or bear and truck) visits Poznań once a month (occasionally more frequently, for example before Christmas), it does not fail to boost spreadsheet numbers. For instance, MiśTruck collected as much as 15,300 zł in November - this is one of the "worst" results and I wonder how much was gathered in December. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that people are so willing to spend their money, considering the purpose and delicious taste of cheese along with other products (yes, cheese is not the only option. Goods like pickles, jelly or syrup are available as well).

In search of this tastiness, we need to go back down to the place of origin, that is, the "factory" in Wętwie, Kashubia. There, a cozy building is located and the famous cheese is manufactured. At this point, I'd like to give a huge shout-out to both charges who give all their dedication and volunteers who work hard with the patience of a saint to deliver the beloved products. It is these people, thanks to whose generosity and sincerity, that make every slice of cheese and pickle delight us. Besides, it is an exemplar of successful coexistence of people from different walks of life working together to achieve a common goal, giving their best 24/7. I'll always stress this fact.

Although justifiably, I got too philosophical. I will switch to more consumable part, describing my journey thorough this endeavor.

# My Journey
# <font size=4>**Take your shot**</font><br>
Stories revolving around the beginnings are marketable. It is easy to fall for hard-luck or inspiring stories because they offer what people secretaly seek - a shed of hope of escaping the misereable reality. I don't deny that some of these stories may be meaningful - some undoubtedly do shed light on certain aspects of our life and help us realize our mistakes. However, to extract the meaningful essence, critical thinking needs to be applied. Thoughts and habits presented can be embraced (and sometimes even should be), but they must be put in context; factors such as background, environment and culture needs to be taken into the consideration. To give an illustration, [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) was a successful man of sheer will and ambition. Fortunately or not, it is not possible to follow the exact same path he took. The conditions and situation have changed significantly since he was in charge. However, what can be learned from him is self-belief and persistency.

This story goes to show that much useful knowledge can be acquired, but it requires thinking. With that in mind, I want to share with you my beginnings, my journey with selling cheese. Probably it is not that interesting, but maybe you'll get something out of it. Here it is:

When I started, I didn't know much about the inner structure of the foundation. At that moment, I collected merely basic information like the general aim, something about Bury Miś camp, and I met my first charge - [Piotr](/portfolio/posts/meeting-charges/#piotr). The lack of knowledge was natural, but I was gradually getting familiar with more and more details, mainly concerning the camp since the reason why I joined Bury Miś was to volunteer as a counselor. Nevertheless, it was not until the camp kicked off that I could broaden my understanding of this complicated mechanism.

(As a remark, I'd like to add that there is a lot to discuss about the camp -- actually two of them -- but it's not the place for it. Now I can only share the charity's newspaper and <a href="newspaper.pdf" target="_blank">the article within it I wrote about the camp: p.4</a>.) 

Being near the headquarters of the organization and among people closely connected with the charity for years, I experienced an awful lot of tiny, essential elements that gives the charity unique character. One of them was cheese: both its taste and trade. I have already touched upon the former, but it is hard to elaborate as this mix of sensations cannot be easily described with words, on paper, without getting into the "physical contact." The latter, on the other hand, is easier to explain and more of interest for the topic of this reflection.

Nevertheless, after the camp, I knew only few things about selling cheese: it is done in MiśTruck and cheese (different kinds of) varies in their shape, smell and the production process. I didn't see a role I could take in this project. I had to wait until the end of holidays to find a message asking for help with selling cheese. While reading, I talked to a friend of mine, Dawid. We came up with an idea of selling cheese together. We offered ourselves and they agreed to introduce both of us to the methodology. Wonderful adventure was only several kilometers apart, in Umultowo.
