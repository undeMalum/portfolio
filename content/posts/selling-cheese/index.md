# A Short Story About Bury Miś And Cheese
Seemingly, Bury Miś Foundation is only a typical organization where enthusiastic volunteers attempt to make the life of the disadvantaged more enjoyable. Indeed, it provides social interaction and support to people who are in strong need of others and struggle to develop bonds with the society, which is worthy of admiration. However, what does differ Bury Miś Foundation from other alike organizations is its complexity. It does not mean that Bury Miś is more relevant because of that. I just want to emphasize my astonishment when I discovered how many activities I can undertake and hence how much I can learn. No matter what it is, whether meeting with charges, being counselor or writing articles - they all are new, exciting and teach me a lot. I especially appreciate selling cheese - not only is it interesting for me, but also proves the self-sufficiency of the charity and fantastically incorporates into its day-to-day life.

[Selling hand-made Kashubian cheese](https://buremisie.org.pl/produkty-z-osady/) constitutes a vital part of the budget. Even though the charity food truck (called MiśTruck by combining words miś or bear and truck) visits Poznań once a month (occasionally more frequently, for example before Christmas), it does not fail to boost spreadsheet numbers. For instance, MiśTruck collected as much as 15,300 zł in November - this is one of the lowest results and I wonder how much was collected in December. People are so willing to spend their money owing to not only the lofty goal, but also the delicious taste of cheese along with other products (yes, cheese is not the only option. Goods like pickles, jelly or syrup are available as well).

In search of this tastiness, we need to go back down to the place of origin, that is, the "factory" in Wętwie, Kashubia. There, a cozy building is located and the famous cheese is manufactured. At this point, I'd like to give a huge shout-out to both charges who give all their dedication and volunteers who work hard with the patience of a saint to deliver the beloved products. It is these people, thanks to whose generosity and sincerity, that make every slice of cheese and pickle delight us. Besides, it is an exemplar of successful coexistence of people from different walks of life working together to achieve a common goal, giving their best 24/7. I'll always stress this fact.

Although justifiably, I got probably too philosophical. I will switch to more consumable part, describing my journey thorough this endeavor.

# My Journey
## Intro
Stories revolving around hitting a home run are marketable. It is easy to fall for hard-luck or inspiring stories because they offer what people secretly seek - a shed of hope of escaping the miserable reality. I don't deny that some of these stories may be meaningful - some undoubtedly do shed light on certain aspects of our life and help us realize our mistakes. However, to extract the meaningful essence, critical thinking needs to be applied. Thoughts and habits presented can be embraced (and sometimes even should be), but they must be put in context; factors such as background, environment and culture needs to be taken into the consideration. To give an illustration, [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) was a successful man of sheer will and ambition. Fortunately or not, it is not possible to follow the exact same path he took. The conditions and situation have changed significantly since he was in charge. However, what can be learned from him is self-belief and persistency.

This story goes to show that much useful knowledge can be acquired, but it requires thinking. With that in mind, I want to share with you my beginnings, my journey with selling cheese. Probably it is not that interesting, but maybe you'll get something out of it. Here it is:

## The Beginnings
When I started, I didn't know much about the inner structure of the foundation. At that moment, I collected merely basic information like the general aim, something about Bury Miś camp, and I met my first charge - [Piotr](/portfolio/posts/meeting-charges/#piotr). The lack of knowledge was natural, but I was gradually getting familiar with more and more details, mainly concerning the camp since it was my goal in joining Bury Miś Foundation: to volunteer as a counselor. Nevertheless, it was not until the camp kicked off that I could broaden my understanding of this complicated mechanism.

(As a remark, I'd like to add that there is a lot to discuss about the camp -- actually two of them -- but it's not the place for it. Now I can only share the charity's newspaper and <a href="newspaper.pdf" target="_blank">the article within it I wrote about the camp: p.4</a>.) 

Being near the headquarters of the organization and among people closely connected with the charity for years, I experienced an awful lot of tiny, essential elements that gives the charity unique character. One of them was cheese: both its taste and trade. I have already touched upon the former, but it is hard to elaborate as this mix of sensations cannot be easily described with words, on paper, without getting into the "physical contact." The latter, on the other hand, is easier to explain and more of interest in the context of this reflection.

Nevertheless, after the camp, I knew only few things about selling cheese: it is done in MiśTruck and cheese (different kinds of) varies in their shape, smell and the production process. I didn't see a role I could take in this project. I had to wait until the end of holidays to find a message on a group chat, asking for help with selling cheese. While reading, I was talking to a friend of mine, Dawid. As a result, we came up with an idea of selling cheese together. We offered ourselves and they agreed to introduce both of us to the methodology. Wonderful adventure was now only several kilometers apart, in Umultowo.

## Process
Even though it was 4 months ago, I still remember the first day well. We had returned home on late Saturday to be ready to leave at 9 o'clock on Sunday. We spent hour and a half on commuting to this distance part of Poznań neighborhood, Umultowo. On our arrival, we met the previous cheese group and switched with them. After some time, another person arrived to instruct us. This person was a friend of mine, fellow counsellor - Ewa. She described briefly the "machinery", that is, cash register and payment terminal and talked a little about the cheese itself and prices. That was all we could do by now. We were in front of church so until the church service terminated, we had nothing to do, but getting to know each other. It was great of course, however, we were remained by one person to be a bit more quite - presumably, we were disrupting. 

Nevertheless, before the end, I had to go for the announcements and invite people to buy our cheese. Much as I'm fairly comfortable with giving speeches, I was stressed and had no clue of how to address people there. "They are catholic, I am atheist; is that make a difference, should I mentions something specific" - those were the kind of questions I kept asking myself. It turned out that I said a bit, but priest had to intervene and add somewhat. Now, I would approach it differently. What is also worth mentioning from that day is my uselessness. Three people were too much for this work. Dawid and Ewa did everything, while I was at most passing the most distant pieces of cheese from time to time. I didn't get bored, but I don't like starring at people working instead of me in general.

It wasn't the last time I was selling cheese. Actually, it continues up to this day with even more occasions, about which more later. The difference, however, is that I have not sold cheese on Sunday since. It is simply more convenient logistically to do it on Saturday. Now, I can move on to some intriguing fragments.

The second time I was in MiśTruck I destroyed both cash register and payment terminal. It wasn't fatal damage. I just overestimated my force when cutting off receipts. Moreover, I made a great deal of mistakes while typing products on the cash register. Because of that, it was a long process to get done with even a single client. However, my advantage was my height, specifically the length of my arms. Contrary to other sellers, I am able to get even the most distant cheese from fridges.

Later, in winter, it was freezing cold. Unfortunately, power was turned off at 2 p.m. Perfect conditions for working outside, I would say. On the other hand, I was significantly more fluent with the cash register. It helped escape my hands from frosty weather and hide in warm gloves. It was particularly important when I was in [Skórzewo](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skórzewo_(województwo_wielkopolskie)), during the additional shift before Christmas.

# School Charity Fair
## Road
The reason I have mentioned the shift in Skórzewo is partially because I want to smoothly switch to another topic which is Scholl Charity Fair. I think that a good point to start is to explain the road that led to this fair since the process is at least as interesting as the fair itself. However, because this blog post/reflection is already quite long, I will create quick and comprehensive bullet points, summarizing a series of events that set the foundation for this enterprise.

To enhance your understanding, follow closely what's written underneath :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::
1. I went on the school trip to Warsaw with second graders
2. I talked to the vice-principal and my math teacher about my volunteer work
3. I mentioned selling cheese
4. Vice-principal proposed the purchase of cheese by school commons
5. After the trip, I visited the main principal
6. He agreed to my proposal and suggested selling during Nativity plays
7. I made a call to Bury Miś to discuss possibilities
8. I worked in MiśTruck and collected cheese samples
9. I brought cheese samples for school cooks to test
10. The price was overkill so the school didn't become a trading partner
11. I paid the principal a second visit regarding School Charity Fair
12. Although reluctant, he made a final agreement
13. I contacted Mrs. Martyna, the elementary school charity coordinator
14. I asked the school cooks for permission to leave cheese at school
15. In Skórzewo I took the document allowing me to sell cheese at school
16. On December 19, I received all products I would be selling
16. At 4 p.m. the same day, I erected my booth for the first time

I hope you didn't get lost! It was quite intensive. I'd be glad if I could make it shorter, but I can't. It's so many important facts out there! Maybe after receiving some feedback I will cut some of it. Anyway, let's come back to the main story.

## Three Days
I believe I've introduced the road sufficiently, so that you have a big (in this case huge) picture of the planning part. The second part will be more descriptive. I'll cover each of the three days I was selling the cheese and the rest of goods.

The first day was an introductory day both for me and parents. I was curious how it would be. I erected the booth just as I finished my English lessons at 4 p.m. I wasn't alone because fellows from the primary school where there as well, raising money for people in need. The downside of it was that I got to fit in tiny hall shoulder to shoulder. However, this "inconvenience" didn't last long as they packed their stuff half past four. From that moment on, it was only me and cheese :yum:. Unfortunately, I didn't sell much, especially knowing how much I sold in two following days. Besides, I couldn't stay until all people left the last performance since I had a train to catch (Extended Essay topics urged me).

The second day was more up-and-coming, even though I started later. From the very first moment, I knew it would go much better. I had just started and I already sold something. Moreover, the good thing was that people were paying more than they should to increase charity's budget. It was great! Furthermore, I spent more time to wait for people from the last show. Although not immediately, I paid off because I sold a lot. The price, however, was waiting longer for the later train.

The last day was the longest one. I finished school earlier than previously so I could even catch parents from the first performances. Furthermore, I was able to get rid of art works, thanks to younger kids who were extremely interested in buying such pretty things. If the second day was great, I don't know how to describe the third one. It was a brilliant summary of all these long days, even though I did not stay that long.

Finally, I can talk a bit about how the fair went overall. It proved to be quite successful. I sold almost everything I had, earning more than 1,000 zł. It is hard to estimate the exact sum because people were giving additional money for the foundation. Nevertheless, I think that even that number is quite good.

# Summing The Whole Thing up
Uff... That was tough, but we're there, eventually! Funny thing though is that there's not much to add. I have been mentioning my thoughts on this matter throughout the article. Admittedly, I might add some details, nuances or whatever. However, it makes no sense to dive deeper. I've already shelled you with a lot of facts. Now I can just say that I'm happy and proud of what I'm doing. It is always a kind of fulfillment when you can acquire such useful skills and conduct engaging "experiments" with them. I see a prospect of repeating such initiatives, enterprises in the future and I'm looking forward to undertake them.

At the very end, I'd like to wish everyone reading now happy New Year. If you were so persistent to survive up to this moment, you don't have to worry because no matter what will happen, what obstacles you may encounter, you'll always find a way. Thanks for your precious attention!
