# A brief summary
Having read the about me section, you should know **I did karate for almost 7 years of my earliest childhood.** Not only was it about "how to hit", but more importantly about `athleticism`. We did a lot of gymnastic, stretching and so on.

I am still very `flexible`, however, when I quited, I stopped stretching entirely, **loosing ability to do the splits.** Nevertheless, when `my disease` appeared I was forced to come back and do it regularly. I wasn't complaining and I even chose my goal - **to do the splits once again**. And that's where I put my effort, each time I exercise.

# The emotional outcome
I have to admit I am proud of myself. I'm **trying hard to accomplish this goal** and, although slowly, **it is finally paying off**. Besides, I really enjoy the process. It's just sheer happiness when you can, in a way, "_time travel_" to your childhood and once again be this `little`, `full-of-energy` kid with these `vivid dreams`. Moreover, it winds me down, helps to deal with an awful a lot of stress everyone experience daily.
