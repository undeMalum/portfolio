# A brief summary
Having read the ["About me"](/portfolio/about/) section, you should know that **I did karate for almost 7 years of my earliest childhood**. Contrary to popular belief, it wasnâ€™t merely about fighting, but primarly about `athleticism`. We did a lot of gymnastics, stretching and so on at the time.

**I am still very flexible because of that**. However, when I quitted, I stopped stretching entirely, losing the ability to do the splits. Nevertheless, when I got my disease diagnosed, I was forced to `go back` and `exercise` regularly. I wasn't complaining though, and I even set my goal - _to do the splits once again_. And that's where I put my effort into each time I exercise.

# The emotional outcome
**I have to admit I am proud of myself.** I'm gradually going ahead with my plan and I see it finally paying off. Besides, I really enjoy the process. It's just `sheer happiness` when you can, in a way, "time travel" to your childhood and once again be this `little`, `full-of-energy` kid with these vivid dreams. Moreover, **it winds me down, helps to deal with an awful lot of stress** everyone experiences on a daily basis.
