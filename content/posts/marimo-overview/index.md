# Why Should You Care?
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) are a cornerstone of the Python ecosystem, especially in research and data science. Their ability to combine code, markdown, results, and visualizations makes them a powerful tool for analysis and communication.

But they also come with well-documented drawbacks: hidden execution order, reproducibility issues, and encouragement of poor coding practices. A 2019 study — [*"A Large-scale Study about Quality and Reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks"*](https://leomurta.github.io/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf)[^fn] — highlighted how these problems undermine reliability at scale.

[^fn]: J. F. Pimentel, L. Murta, V. Braganholo and J. Freire, "A Large-Scale Study About Quality and Reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks," 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), Montreal, QC, Canada, 2019, pp. 507-517, doi: 10.1109/MSR.2019.00077.

It’s no surprise, then, that new tools are emerging to preserve Jupyter’s strengths while addressing its weaknesses.

One of the most promising is [marimo](https://marimo.io) — **a next-generation Python notebook**.

Launched in [August 2023](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/releases/tag/0.1.0), marimo has already gained significant traction, with nearly 700 forks :fork_and_knife: and over 16k stars :star: on [GitHub](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo).

As the [README](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/main/README.md) puts it:

> marimo is a reactive Python notebook: run a cell or interact with a UI element, and marimo automatically runs dependent cells (or marks them as stale), keeping code and outputs consistent. marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python (with first-class SQL support), executable as scripts, and deployable as apps.

In this post, I’ll highlight how marimo solves three persistent Jupyter pain points: **execution order, git-friendliness, and reproducibility**. Instead of just listing marimo’s features, we’ll examine _how_ these issues arise in Jupyter and then see how marimo tackles them differently.

To make this concrete, I’ll use a simple, made-up example that mirrors a real-world workflow. This way, you can follow along step by step and clearly see the contrast.

To wrap up, I’ll share two demos that showcase marimo in action and (hopefully) convince you to give it a try.

Let’s dive in.

# A Very Real Scenario
In our “extremely realistic” scenario, we’ll conduct a *hardcore* mathematical analysis — one that we’ll progressively extend as we go.

We’ll begin with this simple setup:

*** 
{{< figure src="./images/jupyter/jupyter_initial_setup.png" alt="Screenshot presenting the initial setup of the Jupyter Notebook demo." position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="This is how the setup presents itself within Jupyter Notebook." captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: white;" >}}
***

It may look trivial, but it already includes both markdown and code — enough to serve as a foundation for our example.

With that in place, let’s jump straight into the first problem: **execution order**.

*Disclaimer: This post assumes some familiarity with Python and git. If you’re new to either, don’t worry — the examples should still be clear enough to follow along.*

# Pain Point #1: Execution Order
Having this beautiful setup prepared, it would nice if we could actually run it!

So let's do just that in a top-to-bottom manner and observe the results:

As expceted, our analysis yielded number 9, fantastic! This means, everything works just fine.

Now, I would like you to pay attention to the square brackets with numbers (e.g. `[2]`) on the left. The numbers in this brackets
