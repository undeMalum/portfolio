# Video reflection
My channel was... standing idle for quite a time. However, here I am once again to talk with pleasure to you! Today, I discussed YouTube Shorts section of my channel since I haven't done it yet. Never. So it was the high time to do so. Have a seat, make yourself comfortable and watch!
