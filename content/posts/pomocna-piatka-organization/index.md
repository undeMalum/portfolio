# What a day it was!
After I went to the gig dedicated to Pink FLoyd with my grandpa, brother and friend, I had to **wake up at 5:00!** This is because I decided to reach the destination with my `bike`. Compared to a combustion engine `car` or `bus`, bike is argubly **an eco-friendly mean of transport** (and considerably less outside-world-dependent) - hence my choice. Nonetheless, there were nearly 20km to be travelled and no time to waste.

Upon arrival (slightly before 7am), I had to **contact each person** assigned for this period. Fortunately, almost everyone was on time so we could begin. Our first task was to take stuff out from a huge garage and bring it to `the headquarters`. Then, I helped to carve a path for the run, locating 4 flags with the number of kilometers (1km, 2km, 3km and 4km). Next, me and my classmate helped to prepare the start, put the podium and... **that was basically all.** For the rest of the time, we were wondering around, trying to help. The situation changed a bit when the next group showed up, because I explained what's goin' on, but then - `nothing`. So I returned home.

# How do I fell about it?
To say the truth, **this experience was a bit boring.** The idea was great-no doubt about that-but, in my opinion, there was too many people and too little work to be done. We spent there full 3 hours and for the half of the time **we did literally nothing**, besides talking to each other. I believe if we had arrived later for like an hour, it wouldn't have changed a thing - **apart from us having more sleep.** All in all, nice to be a part of something so `influential`, but I have to admit I felt somewhat `useless` during the organizing stage.
