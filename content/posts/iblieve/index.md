# IBlieve
In a [blog posts](/portfolio/posts/resource-center-2/#what-to-add) I wrote a while ago, I mentioned I applied to [IBlieve](https://iblieve.org) - a volunteer organization that helps students to learn. I said that I would create a breakdown of the curriculum of computer science course if I would get accepted. Well, I did get accepted, but I chose different topics, but what exactly? Let's find out!

# Benefits for IB students in the US
The first article was titled "Benfefits for IB students in the US." We were asked to write articles about scholarships specifically dedicated to the IBDP. I was curious how it looks in the US because (much to my disappointment), in most cases, IB does not come with any advantages for students applying to the US.

However, after a lot of research, I found some universities with quite generous offers. You can read the article on the [IBlieve website](https://iblieve.org/benefits-for-ib-students-in-the-us/).

# Elevating Computer Science in IB: A Guide to Resource Center
With this article, I wanted to explain to people how to contribute the [Resource Center](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/) - the website I talked a lot about on this blog ([here](http://localhost:1313/portfolio/posts/resource-center-2/) and [here](http://localhost:1313/portfolio/posts/resource-center/)).

I know I'm going to end my journey with IB rather soon (senior year has just started) and I'm aware I won't have much to time to update the website. Therefore, I wanted to invite others to participate in this awesome endavor and show them how it's done!

The article has not been published yet, but it should soon change.

# Ending
That's all I wanted to say. I konw it's extremely short compared to my other relfections, but I have to shift my focus this year to writing other stuff. Anywat, I hope it was sufficient. Have a good day!
