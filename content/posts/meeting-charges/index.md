I reguraly meet with all of my three "Bears"[^1] from the camp

[^1]: It's a literal translation from Polish (Miś --> Bear). In Bury Miś charity "jargon", caretakers are called "Niedźwiedzie" and charges are reffered to as "Misie" (capital letters since it describes a human). In Polish, miś (generally) is a softer form of niedźwiedź. However, in English, both words are translated as bear so the distinction is lost.
