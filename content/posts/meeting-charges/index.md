# A glimpse into my work
I regularly meet with all my "Bears"[^1] from the camp - Piotr, Marcin, and Adam. Since there are three of them, I visit each triweekly (usually). This is also due to logistic reasons. They live all across Poznań. Commuting unavoidably consumes much of my time and, although I get to know new places (like cozy café in Wilda district!) which is fine, sadly I can't pay them visits more often. Nevertheless, Piotr, Marcin, and Adam are nice people. **Each of them is unique and so are meetings with them.**

# Piotr
Piotr is the oldest and the least active among my charges. One may regard him as "repetitive" because he keeps asking similar questions constantly (especially about one's shoes). I find it rather `sweat` and `adorable`, even though sometimes it may be exhausting. Our meetings are usually based on a-cup-of-tea-with-a-cake pattern, but from time to time I take him for a walk (he's very grateful for that). Very recently, I had planned to go for a concert organized by Bury Miś with him, but unfortunately, he had some problems and it didn't work out. What a pity! **He'd be surely delighted!**

# Marcin
Marcin is the "middle" one, as far as age is concerned. He's shy and at the very beginning it was a bit of a problem. However, as he knows me better, he's more open to conversations. What's more, what an athlete he is! **He's always been into sports and the number of diplomas he's gathered is outstanding!** It does not come as a surprise therefore, that I do a lot of sports with him, particularly football (he's a huge fan of Lech Poznań team). What is also worth-mentioning is him _being an actor_. For instance, on October 10, I went to the theatre performance "Swans" ("Łabędzie") where he acted!

# Adam
Adam has just entered his 30s so he's the youngest. Just like Marcin, Adam is quite shy and very able-bodied. The difference is that Adam's a feet higher! He's tall and massive, but peaceful. I admit, one may run of patience very quickly with his turtle pace and perfectionism. **Anyways, he's lovely with his need for doing "mature stuff"** (this `"desire for manhood"` is the bridge that connects all of my boys and the reason why I was assigned to them). We also bike a lot together, usually around Lake Rusałka or Citadel. Adam has expressed his desire of trying out an electric scooter so we'll definitely give it a go in the near future!

# It's never too late to try authenticity.
I have already touched upon my feelings concerning meetings with the charges, but now is the time to discuss it more thoroughly. First thing first, I must stress the wide `educational` spectrum of working disabled people. Not only do you learn how to make quick decisions and take responsibility for others, but crucially **how to express yourself**. The feelings of people with disabilities are `genuine` and `devoid of any agenda`. This is life-changing; the possibility re-learn true emotions (such as sheer happiness or real anger) whose definitions you once knew as a child, but blurred over the years. And even though you may be annoyed by them, at the end of the day, **you'll appreciate their authentic attitude**.

# Learning outcomes:
- LO 1 Strength and Growth
- LO 2 Challenge and Skills
- LO 3 Initiative and Planning
- LO 4 Commitment and Perseverance
- LO 5 Collaborative Skills
- LO 6 Global Engagement
- LO 7 Ethics of Choices and Actions

[^1]: It's a literal translation from Polish (Miś --> Bear). In Bury Miś charity "jargon", caretakers are called "Niedźwiedzie" and charges are referred to as "Misie" (capital letters since they describe humans). In Polish, miś (generally) is a softer form of niedźwiedź. However, in English, both words are translated as bear so the distinction is lost.
