# Focus
I believe it's pointless to repeat over and over again what IBlieve is and what my role entails. I explained all essentials [here](/portfolio/posts/iblieve/). So let's jump straight to the work I did.

# CAS 101
This article is a bit of an exception because it is not an article as such, but an interview. The story is, I was assigned the following topic: "Do's and Don't's for CAS". However, I had no idea whatsoever how to approach it. Everything I could come up with seemed bold and useless. Fortunately, I experienced enlightenment - what if I would interview my CAS Coordinator? She should have something to say on the subject, right? So off I went.

Although initially uncertain, she agreed to meet with me and answer my questions. We chose a date, but it didn't work out because of some unforeseeable circumstances. Luckily, my interviewee proposed recording her answers and sending them to me.

Now, I had to get text from the recording. I could pay for some speech-to-text generator, but it's too expensive. What I did was I joined all the recordings together in a video editing program and uploaded thus made video to YouTube as private. YouTube automatically creates subtitles, which you can then download. And that's what I did. After some editing, I had a finished article.

Of course, I received some feedback and editing from both the Team Leads and my CAS Coordinator, which certainly added quality to the final product. You can review it on the IBlieve website - [here](https://iblieve.org/cas-101/).

# Unpublished articles
## October
In October, we had to from group and produce some creating writing. The purpose of this task was to introduce writers to the readers via the "Others" tab on the website. I was paired up with someone, however, this person was unavailable and I had to write everything alone. Not that big of a problem.

The theme was sci-fi and I chose to write about prime factorization. I'd like to avoid spoilers and invite you to read the story once it's published. For now, we have to wait.

# November
November is dedicated to changes in curriculum of certain subjects, primarily science, but philosophy was also updated. And I'll be writing about the latter, though I haven't started, but it's about to change soon.

# Performance
I genuinely enjoy providing content for IBlieve. It's something I've been waiting for and attempted with the Resource Center. Yesterday, I had a performance review with the Team Leads where they said they are happy with me on all levels: deadlines, writing quality, responsiveness etc. So it's kind of a boost to keep going.
