# What is this project about?
The project is called [Computer Science Resource Center](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/) (we're working on the name). As you may infer from the name, it's dedicated to computer science, specifically to IBDP course. You can find there the decent overview of the course, including things like: grade boundaries, resources, the description of each assessment component, and the latest news.

Initially, the website was created by [Mr. Bartłomiej Przybylski](https://bap.faculty.wmi.amu.edu.pl/en/) to enhance the communication between the teacher and students. Therefore, after he left our school, this purpose stopped making any sense - it needed to be rethought. This is the moment when I show up. 

Considering how useful this website is, I came up an idea of sharing it with wider audience. I wanted to revive it and take control over management. I had two possibilities to achieve this goal: either to wait for the owner of the [Github repository](https://github.com/bprzybylski/IB-CS-GeS) (where the website is hosted) to merge my changes each time I added something new, or to ask for the permission for editing the repository which means being a co-owner. Fortunately, I met Mr Przybylski at UAM (during [Noc Naukowców](https://www.poznan.nocnaukowcow.pl)) and received the desired permission from him.

Having explained the background story, I would like now to discuss what I have _done_ over the year and then proceed to what I _plan_ to improve in the near future.

# My contribution
## Big picture
My biggest contributions up to this moment are: oncoming changes and YouTube tabs. Of course, there are other changes I made. For instance, I updated deadlines for Internal Assessment. However, I want to focus on these two since they are the most important and interesting.

## Oncoming changes
In chronological order, [oncoming changes tab](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/general-information/oncoming-changes/) was first. The purpose of adding it was to summarize what is going to change with the introduction of a new syllabus. The reason is that my examination session (i.e. May 2024) will be the last one conducted with the old syllabus. Furthermore, compared to biology where refreshing is only about minor details, the new syllabus in Computer Science will be a game-changer, transforming the current course into something completely different. 

However, I want to avoid giving a deep dive into the new curriculum since it's not the appropriate place. But if you're interested, feel welcome to visit the website and check it out by yourself! 

Anyway, something so drastic just must have been talked about in a place like that. I felt responsible for spreading the news, especially because there was no other resource that would not only pinpoint the most significant aspects, but even mention the fact itself. 

That was the rationale behind my work and you can view the fruits of it on the website.

## YouTube resources
Enough of being a kiss-up! Let's move on to the YouTube tab as time is precious and I value yours.

The YouTube tab has been my second major contribution. Thanks to it, I wanted to extend the range of proposed resources because we had offered only books before that. Although books are a great source of knowledge and have a huge number of other benefits, not everyone is into books or simply has sufficient time to go through them. This is why I chose YouTube channels as I found them more convenient for most people. First, teenagers are more familiar with this medium nowadays. Second, YouTube videos are short and concise (at least from the channels I included) so they help to learn particular material.

Besides, I had spent a lot of time on YouTube, acquiring required knowledge, which meant I unconsciously already prepared a nice list of cool and helpful channels. This certainly helped me with supplying good-quality content because I could take advantage of my expertise, rather than using time-consuming trial-and-error approach and trying to figure out everything from scratch. Obviously, what is now available is not the final point. If I find a new, worth-mentioning channel, I will add it immediately.

That's all I had to share as far as already-made contributions are concerned. Once again, I direct you to the website so that you can see what is going on.

# Plans for the future
Apart from talking about the achievements, I would also be delighted to describe you briefly my plans for future developments.

Currently, I'm considering one extension in particular - useful websites/articles. Even though I have already broadened resources section, I have not exhausted all available sources of information. Indeed, there are far more of them than one can imagine. However, a crucial step toward this goal would be adding websites tab. 

It comes as no surprise that I'm not the only one to actively participate in sharing knowledge. The world is full of incomparably more knowledgeable people who contribute enormously to our understanding of this complicated field of computer science. They create their own sites in which they attempt to familiarize others with all those difficult concepts. 

My job, therefore, is to find those online, technical encyclopedias and put them together in one convenient place. This is what websites tab is assigned for.

# At the end...
For the end, I reserved some more general thoughts. 

What I haven't mentioned or at least clearly stated yet is my excitement when the website was announced to us. The idea of creating a thing like that was in itself extremely impressive, not to mention a possibility to actually browse it. So just as I received the link to the website, I didn't waste any second and went straight off to explore this mysterious monster. It was at this moment that I started wondering about being engaged in the development of the website. 

Moreover, it all happened roughly at the time of the second-grade project week when we had to, among other, work on our CAS portfolios. I desperately tried to escape from Google Sites because I got some prior experience with this tool and I didn't like it. I turned to Mr Przybylski for help and suggestions. He proposed a static website generator named Hugo - the "engine" that powers the Resource Center.

After weeks of bitter struggle during the summer 2022, I finally finished my portfolio which you are _notabene_ visiting right now. I'm proud of what I've created, but there's something more essential in this context. By working on my "headquarters", I've learned the skills that enable me to play with the Resource Center and, consequently, create something that is both useful and meaningful - the two things I've been hoping for for such a long time.

Thus, I want to leave you with the following: First, if you see a prospect of building something innovative, go for it. The very act of creation is very fulfilling and you'll really appreciate it. Second, if you are already in the process, be patient and focused on the goal. It may take a while to get done with a project, but do not let it slip. Self-determination is a key component of every success.
