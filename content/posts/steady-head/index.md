# How did I start?
I find it worth-mentioning, `the beginnings`. Why? Because it started when I was "pursuing my football dreams". More specifically, when we (my team at that time) **had the header exam**. To pass, we had to **hit the ball with your head 15 times** (additional 16th hit was for `a higher mark`). As simple as that, right? No, if you have never juggled with your head! **And this was my case.** I felt I was in a bind. Fortunately (arguably though) at that time I suffered an injury (not the last) so I couldn't try. But later, at home, I practiced a lot to achieve eventually these `"15 magical hits"`. **Even after I changed class, I didn't stop**. I have been doing it up to this day, mastering my `ball control`.

Having said that, let's move on to a trick of interest - `steady head`. How did this start? Well, `by accident`. I was practicing my ball control with the head and **unexpectedly, the ball stayed on my head.** It didn't bounce - just sat on my head, controlled by me. **It didn't last long, but was enough for me to keep trying.** 

And here we are - **it's now an essential part of each of my ball control sessions.**

# My attitude toward the process
Frankly speaking - **it's fun to able to do something others can't easily repeat**, if at all. Although I'm conscious that there is a long path ahead to be "_fluent_", but **the future is promising**. Admittedly, sometimes I just do not have enough time to practice. **I put much effort into other things**, however it is football (including steady head) that keeps me `fresh` and helps face `various distractions`. **Just hope one day I'll achieve my goal of fluency.**
