# How did I start?
I find it worth-mentioning, `the beginnings`. Why? Because it started when I was "pursuing my football dreams". More specifically, when we (my contemporary team) **had the header exam**. The passing condition was to **hit the ball with your head 15 times** (additional 16th hit was for `a higher mark`). Simple as that, right? No, if you never juggled with your head! **And this used to apply for me.** I felt I was so screwed. Fortunately (arguably though) at that I had an injury (not the last) so I couldn't try. But later, at home, I practiced a lot to eventually achieve these `"15 magical hits"`. **Even after I changed the class, I didn't stop**. I am doing it up to this day - mastering my `ball control`.

Having said that, let's move on to the trick of interest - steady head. How this started? Well, by accident. I was practicing my ball control with the head and unexpectedly, the ball stayed on my head. It didn't bounce - just lied on my head, controlled by me. It didn't last long, but was enough for me to keep trying. 

And here we are - it's now an essential part of each of my ball control session.

# My attitude toward the process
I can't lie - it's fun to able to do something others can't easily repeat, if at all. Although I'm conscious that there is a long path ahead to be "fluent", but the future is promising. Admittedly, sometimes I just do not have enough time to practice. I put much effort in other things, however this is football (including steady head) that keeps me fresh and helps facing various distractions. Just hope one day I'll achieve my goal of fluency.
