# A dew words to kick off 
I am soo proud of this title! And yes, the pun _is_ intentional!

Why so you may be wondering? Well, judging by the title, after a month-long break from writing, I am going to talk about football activities I have participated in the past month as a distraction from my academic endavors.

More specifically, I am going to discuss [semi-finals of the Polish academic championship](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1628000654813949&set=a.984715115809176) in football and how I got involved in the team represting PUT.

Then, I am also going to talk about a PUT football tournament, organized as a part of the [Sport's Day](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=724353143439003&set=a.142406664966990).

At least that is the structure I initially had in mind for this blog post.

Nothing more I can say, so let's get started!

# Polish academic championship

Before I dive into the tournament itself. I'd like to share a little story.

## Beginnings
When I entered the university, we had a meeting regarding PE lessons. 

_It's a thing required by Polish law that each university program must include PE in their curriculum for at least two semesters._

Anywho, during this meeting, we acquired INCOMPREHENSIBLY important information. But cynisim aside, they also mentioned that PUT had teams in different sports.

I became interested and thought it would be an ideal situation to return to playing in a football team after being forced to resign from doing so in high school (I discussed it at length durign various posts, here's [one example](/portfolio/about/#some-background) which I have already).

Besides, it allowed me to skip PE lessons, but I didn't think about it then.

Anyway, I emailed the football team coach with information regarding my football experience and he told me to come and show what I can do.

The funny part of this story is that, after my first introductory training session, the coach thanked me, but didn't want me on his team. The reason was that I played in the field, not on my nominal position as a goalkeeper because I assumed everyone knew had to do this.

Later my PE coach told me to explicitly tell the coach that I am a freaking _goalkeeper_ and evaluate me on this position. I did so and got in.

What's maybe also worth mentioning is that in the winter semesters, we play futsal, while in the summer semseters, we play football ([info](https://www.niviasports.com/blogs/news/futsal-vs-football) for laicks).

I went to the local games during the futsal, but I wasn't chosen for the team for the futsal championship.

My career in academic footaball changed course in the summer semester and that's where the second part of this chapter begins.
