# A few words to kick off
I'm so proud of this title! And yes, the pun *is* intentional.

Why, you may ask? Well, after a month-long break from writing, I’m back — and today’s post is all about the football-related distractions that helped me survive the recent academic chaos.

Specifically, I’ll be sharing my experience participating in the [semi-finals of the Polish Academic Championship](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1628000654813949&set=a.984715115809176) and how I ended up joining the PUT football team.

I’ll also talk about a local PUT football tournament organized for [Sport’s Day](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=724353143439003&set=a.142406664966990).

At least, that’s the structure I had in mind when starting this post.

Let’s kick things off!

# Polish Academic Championship
Before diving into the tournament itself, I’d like to share a short story.

## Beginnings
When I started university, we had a mandatory meeting about PE lessons.

_(In Poland, universities are legally required to include PE classes in their curriculum for at least two semesters.)_

Most of the meeting was filled with painfully dry but technically important information. That said, one thing did catch my attention: PUT had official university teams in various sports.

I was intrigued. After having to give up team football in high school (something I’ve discussed in earlier posts — [here’s one](/portfolio/about/#some-background)), this seemed like the perfect opportunity to make a return.

And yes, skipping PE classes was a bonus — though that wasn’t my motivation at the time.

So I emailed the football coach, gave him a quick summary of my playing experience, and was invited to an open training session.

Here’s where it gets funny.

At that first training session, I played on the field — not as a goalkeeper, my actual position — because I just assumed everyone knew I was a keeper and that it was just a standard practice.

Spoiler: they had no clue and no such practice existed.

The coach thanked me for showing up… but told me I wasn’t what he was looking for.

Later, my PE instructor told me to be direct and *tell* the coach that I was a goalkeeper. I did, got reevaluated — and got in.

Also worth mentioning: during the winter semester, we play futsal, while in the summer semester, we play traditional football ([a quick primer for the unfamiliar](https://www.niviasports.com/blogs/news/futsal-vs-football)).

I participated in local futsal games during the winter, but didn’t make the team for the futsal championship.

Things changed in the summer. And that’s where the second part of the story begins.

## Semi-finals
After winning the 2025 Poznań Academic Football League, our team earned a spot in the semi-finals of the Polish Academic Championship.

I was thrilled — not just because we made it that far, but also because I was finally playing full matches and holding my own. Not a bad comeback, all things considered.

Plus, traveling to a new city with the team felt like the perfect mix of competition and adventure.

We arrived on May 18th, with matches scheduled to start the next day. That evening, we all went out for pizza — a much-needed refuel after the long journey. Apart from a *very* dramatic couple at the motel (the love-hate, shouting type), everything went smoothly.

### Game day 1
Our first match kicked off around 11 a.m. — not too early, but still a slow start for us. We faced our local rivals, AWF Poznań ([University of Physical Education](https://awf.poznan.pl/en/university/)).

The first half was rough; we almost conceded. But we bounced back in the second half with renewed energy and came out on top with a solid [3–1 win](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1632449364369078&set=a.984715112475843).

At 3 p.m., we had our second match — less than ideal timing since lunch was arriving right around then. Our opponents, the University of Gdańsk ([Uniwersytet Gdański](https://en.ug.edu.pl)), had more time to rest between games.

Again, we struggled in the first half, which ended 1–1. But in the second half, we regrouped, scored another goal, and secured a [2–1 victory](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1632588537688494&set=a.984715112475843).

Later that evening, we learned that every other match in our group had ended in a draw. That meant we were guaranteed first place in the group, regardless of the outcome of our next match.

Perfect! We could take it easy the next morning and focus all our energy on the final qualifying match.

### Game day 2

We started May 20th by [losing 6–1](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1633266847620663&set=a.984715112475843). It was the first and only match I played in, but honestly, no one minded.

Our opponents, AWFiS Gdańsk ([University of Physical Education and Sport](https://awf.gda.pl/uczelnia/o-uczelni/international/)), *had* to win big to have a chance at the next round — and they did.

We didn’t *want* to lose like that, but our priority was clearly the afternoon match. Everyone knew it. Even the referee wrapped things up 10 minutes early. No one complained — the game had become more of a formality than a competition.

### The final match
A few hours later, it was time for the decisive match. Our rivals had a clear advantage: they came from a three-team group, had one match less, and didn’t play at all that morning. We were tired — but determined.

Unfortunately, nothing went as planned.

Our midfielder was booked for allegedly diving in the box (he was definitely kicked in the shins), and defensive errors led to our opponents scoring three goals.

But we didn’t give up.

Our substitute netted one, and then our captain — yes, the one with the yellow — scored again. Suddenly, it was 3–2.

The pace picked up dramatically. Cards were flying — lots of yellows and even two reds. The match was so intense the referee added nearly 15–20 minutes of stoppage time.

We pressed hard, dominated possession, created chances… but the third goal just wouldn’t come. We [lost](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1633476340933047&set=a.984715112475843).

It was a heartbreaking end — we had such a strong squad, and we were missing three key players due to injury. Still, we showed character, played well, and created memories. Everyone got time on the pitch, even if just for a few minutes.

After the match, any plans for celebrating quickly evaporated. Most of us packed up and took the same train back that evening.

And even though we didn’t make it to the finals, I’m incredibly grateful for the experience. It was a beautiful chapter of my university life — filled with football, friendship, and the kind of moments that stay with you long after the final whistle.

Even though the academic championship ended for this academic year, there were other opportunitied to play competetive football - for example the Sport's Day.

# Sport's Day
Sport's Day is an yealy initivative by the Sport's Center at PUT that breaks participation records every year.
