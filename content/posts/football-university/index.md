# A few words to kick off
I'm so proud of this title! And yes, the pun *is* intentional.

Why, you may ask? Well, after a month-long break from writing, I’m back — and today’s post is all about the football-related distractions that helped me survive the recent academic chaos.

Specifically, I’ll be sharing my experience participating in the [semi-finals of the Polish Academic Championship](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1628000654813949&set=a.984715115809176) and how I ended up joining the PUT football team.

I’ll also talk about a local PUT football tournament organized for [Sport’s Day](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=724353143439003&set=a.142406664966990).

At least, that’s the structure I had in mind when starting this post.

Let’s kick things off!

# Polish Academic Championship
Before diving into the tournament itself, I’d like to share a short story.

## Beginnings
When I started university, we had a mandatory meeting about PE lessons.

_(In Poland, universities are legally required to include PE classes in their curriculum for at least two semesters.)_

Most of the meeting was filled with painfully dry but technically important information. That said, one thing did catch my attention: PUT had official university teams in various sports.

I was intrigued. After having to give up team football in high school (something I’ve discussed in earlier posts — [here’s one](/portfolio/about/#some-background)), this seemed like the perfect opportunity to make a return.

And yes, skipping PE classes was a bonus — though that wasn’t my motivation at the time.

So I emailed the football coach, gave him a quick summary of my playing experience, and was invited to an open training session.

Here’s where it gets funny.

At that first training session, I played on the field — not as a goalkeeper, my actual position — because I just assumed everyone knew I was a keeper and that it was just a standard practice.

Spoiler: they had no clue and no such practice existed.

The coach thanked me for showing up… but told me I wasn’t what he was looking for.

Later, my PE instructor told me to be direct and *tell* the coach that I was a goalkeeper. I did, got reevaluated — and got in.

Also worth mentioning: during the winter semester, we play futsal, while in the summer semester, we play traditional football ([a quick primer for the unfamiliar](https://www.niviasports.com/blogs/news/futsal-vs-football)).

I participated in local futsal games during the winter, but didn’t make the team for the futsal championship.

Things changed in the summer. And that’s where the second part of the story begins.

## Semi-finals
After winning the Poznań academic football of 2025, we received a pass to the semi-finals of the Polish Academic Championship.

I was thrilled becuase I finally played matched in their entirity and I wasn't performing poorly as well. I would say, the return wasn't half as bad as one could expect.

Moreover, I had an opportunity to travel to a new city with people from the team so it also seemed like a nice trip.

We arrived 18th of May, but matches started the next day so we went out to grab a pizza because everyone was hungry after the trip. With everyone tired and excited for the next day, nothing much happened, altough, at the motel that we were staying in, there was a toxic couple of the love-and-hate type so there was a lot of shouting, but apart from that, everything went really smoothly.

Next day, we played rather late, 11 or os. We were matched against out local rival - AWF Poznań ([Poznań University of Physical Education](https://awf.poznan.pl/en/university/)). After a troubling first half and almost losing a goal, we were reborn in the second half and went on to win the match [3:1](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1632449364369078&set=a.984715112475843).

We played another match at 3 pm, which wasn't ideal as it was the time of lunch arrival so we would be a little hungry. But so were out rivals, though they had more time to relax after their first game. The next match, against the Uniwersytet Gdański ([University of Gdańsk](https://en.ug.edu.pl)) began similarly in that we sucked in the first half, that finished with 1:1 on the scoring board, but we went thourgh, scored one more goal and [won 2:1](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1632588537688494&set=a.984715112475843).

Later that evening, we also learned that we had a guaranteed first place in the group (the scheme of the tournament was three groups on with three teams and two with four teams and two first places from the group played one more match for qualifying into the finals of the Polish Academic Championship in Football) because all other matched in our group were draws.

It was an ideal situation because we could do whatever in the first match the next day and preserve our vigor for the most important, last match that gave us qualifications.

So we began the 20th of May by [loosing 6:1](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1633266847620663&set=a.984715112475843), it was also the first and only match that I played in, but no one cared. Our oponents AWFiS Gdańsk ([Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport](https://awf.gda.pl/uczelnia/o-uczelni/international/)) had to win significantly in order to had a chance at playing in the qualifying match.

Naturally, we didn't want to lose so high, but more than that we cared about the next match and prefered to conserve energy for that one. It maybe a shame that it turned out like that, but even our opponents understood the situation and we all made fun of this match in the second half that the referee even finished 10 minuted before he should. But one one cared as the match was an unwanted formality.

So now, we had a few hours to spare before the grand match that would decide out faith. We were in a worse position than our rivals who, being from the three-team group not only had one match less, but also didn't play any matched in the morning and had a whole day to rest.

But we didn't care and just wanted to win.

Unfortunately, nothing went as planned. After our middlefielder received a yellow after allegedly simulating a foul in the penalty box (to be honest, he was kicked pretty hard in the shanks), we made many terrible mistaked in the defense, which our rivals took full advantage of, scoring 3 goals.

That wasn't an ideal situation for the second half. Forunately, out subsitute scored the first goal giving us hope. Later, our captain (the one with the yellow) scored for the second goal and it was now 3:2. 

The match was really energetic, many yellow card were given and even two red ones. Because of all the on-pitch situations, the referee added like 15-20 minutes in total. However, nothing helped, and even though we dominated on the pitch, we couldn't get a hand of the third goal, which led to us [losing](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1633476340933047&set=a.984715112475843).

It's such a shame because he had a really good squad that could make a really big difference in the finals. We were also three players short because three guys had injuried. Yet, we showed chracter, a little bit of good play and found memoried. Besides, everyone played! Even for a little while!

After the game, everyone abondoned the plans for partying till the next day and almost everyone returned on the same train.

Even though we didn't advance, I am really happy for this experience!!
