# Amplified greetings
It finally happened!

As I mentioned in my [previous posts](/portfolio/posts/engineers-talks/#final-remarks), I attended the [GHOST Day: Applied Machine Learning Conference](https://ghostday.pl). The highlight? Unveiling our [GHOSTxIRIM](https://github.com/GHOST-Science-Club/tree-classification-irim?tab=readme-ov-file#about-the-project) project after six months of hard work.

But I didn’t just present—I networked, met new people, strengthened existing connections, and learned a ton. It was an intense and rewarding two days.

# GHOSTxIRIM
Kuba ([GitHub](https://github.com/rojberr)) and I presented GHOSTxIRIM during the student session—a rapid-fire format of 7-minute talks (+3 minutes Q\&A).

The short time slot pushed us to be razor-sharp. We spent countless hours refining our slides, cutting content, applying feedback, and rehearsing. Honestly, preparing the talk took more time than writing the code!

But it paid off. We received thoughtful questions and encouraging feedback—not just on our talk, but the project itself. It was validating and reinforced our belief in the project's potential impact.

Also, being a speaker with an interesting topic is a great icebreaker—conversations came easily!

More updates are coming once our next steps for GHOSTxIRIM are set. Big things ahead—stay tuned!

# Meaningful encounters
One of the most rewarding parts of the conference was meeting so many new people. Honestly, the last time I connected with this many strangers was probably at summer camp in sixth grade!

I had great conversations, gained fresh perspectives, and learned a lot—from tech topics to tram routes in Poznań.

At the booths, I spoke with [Bartek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dzionek/) from Google. We had a great tech-focused talk, and he was genuinely interested in our project. He shared a story about an ecology initiative he once contributed to—badgers had become an invasive species in a Polish region, and ecologists were manually sorting thousands of motion-triggered photos. Bartek trained a simple CNN model to detect badgers with \~90% accuracy, drastically improving the workflow. A simple yet impactful use of ML!

I also visited the [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.com) booth, where a funny moment occurred: I greeted the rep in Polish, only to realize he only spoke English. In return, he gave me a generous amount of merch—didn’t want to pack it home, apparently!

The OLX booth was run by a friendly team, but merch came with a twist—you had to play a game to earn it. They weren’t offering internships, but I did later bump into [Jędrzej Kopiszka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jędrzej-kopiszka-8ab338155/?originalSubdomain=pl) from OLX after his fraud detection lecture. Though I missed the talk, he kindly explained their work—detecting scam listings, trafficking, and explicit content. These problems seem obvious in hindsight, yet I had never considered them in that context. Thought-provoking stuff.

I also had a brief chat with [Chih-Chen Kao](https://drkao.cc) from AMD, who gave a lecture on ray tracing. I didn’t grasp all the technical details, but I approached him afterward to ask about studying at TUM. It turned out he just lives there, but he was incredibly friendly, and we had more time to chat during the afterparty.

Lastly, I met two fellow Student Session presenters:

- [Kacper Cybiński](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kacper-cybiński-5764601b4/) from the University of Warsaw, who talked about using neural networks in physics research—a deep topic that went over my head at first. I caught up with him the next day to dive deeper, and he kindly explained everything.
- [Kacper Wachnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kacper-wachnik-5b2860252/) from PUT, who presented his master's thesis project _MisterCar_—a framework for creating AI agents in games, capable of detecting sound or controlling vehicles. He’s even planning to start a new section in the GHOST student organization, which I think is a fantastic initiative.

I could go on, but to sum it up: I met so many fascinating people, and each interaction made the conference even more valuable.

# Non-conventional study experience
Normally when we think about studying or, in general, acquiring new knowledge, we think about going to school, attending a lecture, or revising at home.

However, it turns out that a conference is also a brilliant way to learn and broaden your horizon. You may not become an expert after half an hour or possibly hour-long presentation, but you surely will benefit from becoming familiar with a new perspective on a known topic or even learning a new concept in its entirety.

The latter was particularly to me during the GHOST Day.

For instance, the first keynote speaker: Maya Bechler-Speicher from Meta. She had an interesting talk about how using graphs and graph neural networks (GNNs) may not always be ideal. It's because graphs may not always adequatly represent all intricasies of the encoded structure. A point in case is representing proteins as a graph: although we can embedded a protein as a sequence of amino acids, it may not include information on other bonds between non-consecutive proteins. That was my main takeaway from her presentation-frankly, I didn't fully grasp the rest of the presentation, other than the fact that we can make our original graph embedding more like a regular graph because empiral results suggest that these kind of grpahs yeild the best results.
