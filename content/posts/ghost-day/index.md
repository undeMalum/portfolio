# Amplified greetings
It finally happened!

As I mentioned in my [previous posts](/portfolio/posts/engineers-talks/#final-remarks), I attended the [GHOST Day: Applied Machine Learning Conference](https://ghostday.pl). The highlight? Unveiling our [GHOSTxIRIM](https://github.com/GHOST-Science-Club/tree-classification-irim?tab=readme-ov-file#about-the-project) project after six months of hard work.

But I didn’t just present—I networked, met new people, strengthened existing connections, and learned a ton. It was an intense and rewarding two days.

# GHOSTxIRIM
Kuba ([GitHub](https://github.com/rojberr)) and I presented GHOSTxIRIM during the student session—a rapid-fire format of 7-minute talks (+3 minutes Q\&A).

The short time slot pushed us to be razor-sharp. We spent countless hours refining our slides, cutting content, applying feedback, and rehearsing. Honestly, preparing the talk took more time than writing the code!

But it paid off. We received thoughtful questions and encouraging feedback—not just on our talk, but the project itself. It was validating and reinforced our belief in the project's potential impact.

Also, being a speaker with an interesting topic is a great icebreaker—conversations came easily!

More updates are coming once our next steps for GHOSTxIRIM are set. Big things ahead—stay tuned!
