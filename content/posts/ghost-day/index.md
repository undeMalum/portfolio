# Amplified greetings
It finally happened!

As I mentioned in my [previous posts](/portfolio/posts/engineers-talks/#final-remarks), I attended the [GHOST Day: Applied Machine Learning Conference](https://ghostday.pl). The highlight? Unveiling our [GHOSTxIRIM](https://github.com/GHOST-Science-Club/tree-classification-irim?tab=readme-ov-file#about-the-project) project after six months of hard work.

But I didn’t just present—I networked, met new people, strengthened existing connections, and learned a ton. It was an intense and rewarding two days.

# GHOSTxIRIM
Kuba ([GitHub](https://github.com/rojberr)) and I presented GHOSTxIRIM during the student session—a rapid-fire format of 7-minute talks (+3 minutes Q\&A).

The short time slot pushed us to be razor-sharp. We spent countless hours refining our slides, cutting content, applying feedback, and rehearsing. Honestly, preparing the talk took more time than writing the code!

But it paid off. We received thoughtful questions and encouraging feedback—not just on our talk, but the project itself. It was validating and reinforced our belief in the project's potential impact.

Also, being a speaker with an interesting topic is a great icebreaker—conversations came easily!

More updates are coming once our next steps for GHOSTxIRIM are set. Big things ahead—stay tuned!

# Network, meetings, and more
Another unique opportunity that I have experienced during the conference was talking to and meeting vast number of people.

Frankly, the last time I connected with so many new people was probably a summer camp in the 6th grade!

But I can't complain. I could talk about interesting things and get new perspectives on different matters.

I met new people from Allegro-it turned out that two of them are currently studying and PUT (my uni). They said that Allegro is actually a good place to be working-what a pity that I missed the deadline for applying to the internships! 

In spite of this, we could talk about the conference, odd tram routes (typical for Poznań), and Dr. Kraft who, by the way, supervises the GHOSTxIRIM project.

I also met poeple from other institutions that had their stand during the conference. For instance, I talked with [Bartek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dzionek/) who works at Google. It was a really nice conversation that combined technology and advices. 

He was also really interested in out project! He even shared that, in the past, he also contributed to a project dedicated to ecology-there was a region in Poland where badgers were an invasive species and ecologists set up cameras to monitor their population. However, cameras were extremely sensitive to movement-so much so that they could pick up moving grass. Ecoligist, who are mainly non-technical, were manually going through thousands of photos to detect badgers. However, Bartek trained a simple CNN to could detect badgers with 90-ish accuracy, which of course, sped up the process of counting badgers.

Such a simple, yet very applicable project idea!

There were also stand from [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.com) where a guy there spoke only English. It wasn't a problem at all. but I approached him speaking Polish because all other people at stands were Polish. It was a little funny encounter, especially because he gave me so much merch (he didn't want to bring it back home).

There was also a booth from OLX. The girls there were really nice. However, they didn't just give the merch, you had to play a game first where you scored points and received merch accordingly. They didn't offer any internships  though.

On the upside, however, there was a lecture from OLX by [Jędrzej Kopiszka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jędrzej-kopiszka-8ab338155/?originalSubdomain=pl) on fraud detection. I didn't attend his session, however, I did stumle upon him in the Speakers chambers after he gave his talk. I saw that he is from OLX and asked what his talk was about. And he explained in details what they detect, including scam offers, human and drug trafficig as well as nude content. These topics seemed so obvious when he was talking about them, and I started wondering why I haven't ever thought of that. I still don't know, but it seems as an intersting topic to ponder about.

I have also talked with [Chih-Chen Kao](https://drkao.cc) from AMD who gave lecture on ray-tracing. Although I didn't understand much, I did approached him after the lecture to inquire about the studies at TUM, however, it turned out that he just lives there, not attend the university. However, he was a really nice gut and a pleasure to talk to! I could talk to him a little more during the afterparty.

On top of that, I have also talked to two students from the Student Session: [Kacper Cybiński](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kacper-cybiński-5764601b4/) from the University of Warsaw and [Kacper Wachnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kacper-wachnik-5b2860252/) from PUT. The former guy had a presentation about using neural networks to assist physics research. It was a complex topic, really hard to convey in 7 minutes and I didn't understand much-mainly because of the my lack of background in physics. However, I talked to him during a lunch break the next day to inquire about his topics because it was itching me insides that I didn't quite get it. He was more than happy to expand on his research. We also chatted a little afterwards.

The former presenter gave a talk on his project/master's thesis MisterCar. It is a framework to built in-game AI agent that can interact with the environment-detecting sound or steering a car. It was a really nice idea to assisst your gaming experience. I caught up with him later on and he told me that he even plans to open up a section in the GHOST student organization, which I find really awesome!

I could still go on for a while, but this section is getting overly long and a little random-after all, I just enumerate and explain my encounters. The point is, I have met so many interesting people and I really valued this experience.
