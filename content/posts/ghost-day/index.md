# Amplified greetings
Finally, it happenned! [GHOSTxIRIM](https://github.com/GHOST-Science-Club/tree-classification-irim?tab=readme-ov-file#about-the-project) has been revealed to the wider audience during the [GHOST Day: Applied Machine Learning Conference](https://ghostday.pl).

I have announced GHOST Day in my [previous posts](/portfolio/posts/engineers-talks/#final-remarks), but having gone through the conference at last give totally different vibes!

I have done so many things there: from GHOSTxIRIM project presentation, through networking, meeting new people, learning new things and much more. It's been intensive two days-I can certainly tell you that!
