# In a rush
I confess, the only reason I'm writing this particular reflection is to wrap up this month's activity and dive into creativity and service. It's not that I've had a change of heart about sportsâ€”definitely not! It's just that there's not much progress to share, almost nothing if I'm being honest. I simply want to get this over with.

The urgency comes from some changes I've made to the Resource Center and a new charge at Bury Mis that I'm excited to talk about. However, I find myself a bit behind on my activity.

Anyway, it is what it is. Let's see. Maybe I'm being overly dramatic?

# Kind of progress
Today, you're going to exclusively see photos of my splits. Why? Purely by accident.

To the point, while I'm uncertain about my ability to widen my leg split beyond what I previously reflected on, I've discovered I can lower my chest closer to the ground in my full split. You'll get a clearer picture of what I mean from one of the attached photos.

I think it looks nice, but of course, that's just my opinion. I have this tendency to brag about myself and exaggerate things I do, mainly to amuse myself with hyperbole. Besides, in primary school, I used to underestimate everything I did, and I didn't enjoy it. So, I switched to the other side of the spectrum. Is it a good thing? Time will tell.

However, there's a more important question: WHY AM I TALKING ABOUT IT?

Firstly, because I can. Secondly, I'm aiming for transparency with the audience, providing the full context of who I am.

So, you're free to form your opinion about how cool this thing I mentioned looks. In fact, I encourage you to do so. But, you have to know, IT IS COOL. We may only disagree on to what extent.

# Something
Enough of the show-off; it's time for action!

At this point, I'm not even sure what I'm talking about. I lost my focus; it's too late. I'm tired and need to prepare for an alumni interview at Dartmouth. I don't like being unprepared; I want to have a nice conversation. I'll learn something, for sure. Will I get accepted? I wish I knew.

I can only wait and do everything I can. But I'll keep doing the splits. In fact, once I finish this piece, I'm doing cardio and then proceeding to the splits. I won't be stopping.

I should reflect on juggling as well... Okay, that's enough. I'm exhausted. Bye!!
