# Ridiculousness
Normally, I would report something about stretching, a new exercise, or football. However, painting my fence took me so long and exhausted so much that I barely had strength to do anything else. So I thought to myself "what's stopping me from reflecting on this? NOTHING" (beside the fact that my brother was the one to whom the task was initially assigned, but he needed some proper motivation it turned out.)

# Course of action
## Massaging wood
The old rule states that if you want to paint an old, wooden fence, you first need to scratch off as much previous color as you can. To do so, you need a wire brush, which is basically a normal brush except instead of a soft material, you have steel (some people use it to remove corrosion).

Scratching old color was extremely tedious and tiring, physically. It took a lot of time to brush the fence to a satisfactory degree. Plus, my hands were useless after two hours of such activity. If I hadn't had a brother to help me, I would have abandoned the work for a next few years. Fortunately, I could rest and watch him do his part.

## Putting color
After never-ending scratching, we were ready to put a new color into action. The thing is, I was totally wrong to assume that painting would be way pleasant because it wasn't. Admittedly, it wasn't so God damn tiring. But still, it consumed a considerable amount of my free time - not to mention that we quickly ran out of paint and needed to purchase more to finish the first and start second layer of paint.

In spite of those obstacles, we finally arrived at our destination. I'm in no position to judge whether it looks better or not, but it's for sure interesting. Besides, I'm happy it's over :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

# Complaining
Although painting in itself wasn't very exciting, I really enjoyed doing something cool for my mum. That part is the most satisfying. In addition to that, I did some muscles, which is also great. 

Apart from the fence, I'd like to mention that I'm going to make my reflection shorter. Not that I lost motivation. I lost time to do so. After all, EE and IAs are demanding enough. I hope you don't mind.
