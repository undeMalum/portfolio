# A memory refresher
The last time I shared updates on my IBlieve journey was a year ago... according to calendar because actually it was two months ago, in the first half of November, but I couldn't resist a New Year joke. Anyway, such a large time gap can negatively affect our memory, so let's quickly revisit what I discussed previously.

The last blog post on my involvement in IBlieve featured a [huge section on unpublished articles](/portfolio/posts/iblieve-3), all of which are now published. This includes a creative-writing story about a friendship and prime numbers (where I celebrate my nerdy side hurraaaay!) and a Philosophy syllabus updates summary.

What's also important about the creative-writing article is that I had to write a 150-word blurb/teaser so that the story could be advertise on the organization's Instagram profile. You can see it in the cover of this post, but it's barely redeable. So I'll paste it here: 
> “Prime Quality Friendship” takes you on a journey through the lives of James Ross and Nigel Hawking, two college friends attending Massachusetts Polytechnic. During a wild college party, they stumble upon a groundbreaking mathematical discovery with the potential to destabilize the world economy. Faced with a moral dilemma, they must decide whether to use their discovery for personal gain or reveal it to authorities, a choice that challenges their friendship and continues to haunt them in later years. This gripping tale explores the complexities of ethics, personal benefit, and the enduring impact of decisions made in the heat of the moment.

You can read the whole story on [IBlieve's blog](https://iblieve.org/prime-quality-friendship/).

Regarding the Philosophy updates, the article provides a nice overview of the changes with essential information, accessible even without prior knowledge of the IB Philosophy course. I discuss the benefits these changes should bring. For a better understanding, read the full article [here](https://iblieve.org/complex-yet-intriguing-unpacking-the-philosophy-syllabus-update/).

That wraps up the updates, but I also have a newly-written article to share, so let's jump to it.

# IB, not DP
As some of you may know, the IB organization, besides DP, offers different programs at both the secondary level of education and below. For instance, we have a Middle Years Programme (MYP) designed for kids between the ages of 11 and 16. 

This is what I devoted my article to—a detailed explanation and the benefits of the MYP. As of today, the article has not been published, but it'll soon change.

# Time off and deadlines
I'd like to mention one more thing. The current period of January and February is going to be crazy for me. I have deadlines for TOK, EE, CS, math, biology, Valentines, mock exams, pre-graduation ball, and more.. much more.

It's a lot, and unfortunately, I won't be able to fit in any articles for IBlieve, although the topic seems interesting: what IB is like in your country? It covers aspects like the admission process, common subjects offered, student community, and so on. Since I'm taking IB in Poland, I'll surely have something to say (I have seen only one more person from Poland, but she was on the socials team if I remember correctly).

# Sayonara!
All in all, I stay busy, and I like it that way, actually. I had a long, bad period where I couldn't do anything. I just wasn't able to motivate myself. It was really strange and I was afraid of how this year would turn out, considering the fact that I lost a characteristic that defined me - hard work.

Fortunately, I got on the right track several months ago, and I've been prospering since then. IBlieve is just one example, but a big one, I admit. I love it, and I have no regrets that I chose to join. It's awesome!

Now, I'm going to be working on the Resource Center. I should focus on TOK and EE, but they're basically finished, and I only need to polish them. Besides, I want to have some fun!

See you later!
