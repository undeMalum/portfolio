# School Art Festival
School Art Festival was quite a journey. In the video below you can learn more about how it was done, why I participated, and what is my opinion. Enjoy!

# Christmas Cards
As mentioned in the video, in between performances, we could make Christmas cards for [Hospicjum Palium](https://hospicjum-palium.pl) in Pozna≈Ñ. I believe it was a **great initiative** by the organizers. Besides, I really enjoyed making these cards. Here is a taste of how it looked like:

# Youtube Shorts
As far as I'm concerned, what is also worth mentioning in this context is YouTube Shorts. (For those who are not familiar with them, YouTube Shorts are TikTok-like short vertical videos.) Having a recording of my "show", I thought to myself that it may be a good idea to choose the best part and upload it as YouTube Shorts. It took a while for me to learn how to do this. However, it turned out to be fairly simple. It works as a regular YouTube video, except it has to be in vertical format and does not exceed 60 seconds. Reasonable conditions I would say.

Anyway, I did it, that is, I made a short video as YouTube shorts, which you can view on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eiIcI5p7xZw). What surprised me the most was the fact that, in two hours, it beated all my videos in terms of views. I mean, it's amazing. As of now, I am going to produce more shorts. First, it consumes considerably less time. Second, it simply makes views. **In other words, pragmatism pays off and I love that.**

I also uploaded the full performance:
