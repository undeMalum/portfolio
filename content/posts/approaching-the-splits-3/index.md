# Intro real quick
I have already discussed extensively problems with [documenting my progress](/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits-2/#excuse) so I won't be talking about it here. All I want to do here is sum up how much more (hopefully) my muscles have become flexible.

# Muscles extension
The title is misleading as my muscles are not longer, but can be stretched more. As always, it is not easy to measure how exactly I progressed. Suffice to say, I feel more space and I'm closer to finally achieve the splits! However, I have to admit that how far I can go varies between days. I don't know why this is happening, but sometimes I can go further than ever before and sometimes I'm unable to even go as deep as a day before. This is a strange mechanism.

One more thing I want to mention is that something happened to my thigh. More specifically, I feel pain while stretching my left leg. I have no clue what it is, but I had a break from stretching (less than a week so not even a break really) and after I came back I started feeling pain. It is strain? Maybe, but I haven't seen a doctor and can't tell for sure. For now, I'll just leave it because it doesn't interfere with my daily routine and after each session of stretching its get better so we'll see.

# Closing statement
I know this was short, but I don't know what else I can tell you. Everything about my journey with stretching has already been explained in two previous reflections (if you haven't seen them, here are the link - [first](/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits) and [second](/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits-2)). I'm just happy I'm getting more flexible because my illness would kill me otherwise. Thanks for your attention and see you other times! Bye!
