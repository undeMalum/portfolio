# Quick hello

Hey evryone! I'm back after a _not_ so long brake-at last, considering my previous track. But I hope that things are changing for good.

Anyway, today I'd like to talk about an additional course I joined at the university, which I really enjoy. 

It's called **_Decoding Life Signals: Innovations in Biomedical Engineering_** (or _Decoding Biosignals_ for short) and is dedicated to ["understanding and analyzing the electrical signals that our bodies generate"](https://github.com/SIPPRE/DecodingLifeSignals/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#course-description).

However, before I proceed with explaining this course, I need to mention that, _technically_, I didn't join this course _at_ my university, at least not per se. 

Maybe let's kick off from here so as to not confuse you more.

# EUNICE University

My alma mada, Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, is a part of an alliance of [ten European universities](https://eunice-university.eu/home/campus/), each from a different country.

This "alliance" is called [**EUNICE**](https://eunice-university.eu/home/mission/)-the European University for Customised Education-and is sometimes referred to as EUNICE University.

What is EUNICE about?

Well, to my understanding, it's about joining forces and fostering multicultural environment in research, education and opportunities.

The education part is of particular interest to this post. It consists of blended intensive programs, summer schools, and semester courses.

The latter, semester courses, is the only thing I'm going to focus on-because that's what the Decoding Biosignals course is-but I recommend you read more on the [EUNICE website](https://eunice-university.eu).

## Semester courses
Semester courses are, you guessed, courses that last a whole semester.

There are just regular courses in that you have lectures as well as assignments, and you receive ECTS points upon successful completion of the program's requirements.

They may count toward your degree your univeristy accept it, but if not, you still get a supplement to your diploma and more crucially, interesting knowledge (in my case, I really love it!). 

Semester courses are by professors from the EUNICE universities. They are usually run online-after all, it's hard to make people from 10 countries to meet weekly.

The sign-up process is really easy [explain how I signed up]
