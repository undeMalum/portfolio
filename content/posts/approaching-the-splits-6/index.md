# Up to speed

There's a noticeable gap between this reflection and the previous one, mainly due to the mock exams that consumed much of my time in the past 2-3 weeks. This, coupled with other blog topics and life events, delayed this update.

Before diving into my progress on the splits, I want to clarify a couple of things mentioned in previous posts:

Firstly, [the handstand series](/portfolio/posts/handstand/) has been abandoned. I grew tired of explaining its safety and many concerns about potential injuries. Time constraints also played a role in this decision.

Secondly, [the series on stretching my back](/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits-4/#cheering-up) may not materialize soon. While I continue practicing, documenting the progress is currently on hold.

With that out of the way, let's dive into my latest progress on the splits.

# Almost there!
Exciting news—I'm almost there with my women's splits! Just a few more centimeters to go, and I'll have achieved this goal I've been working on since 8th grade. The prospect of doing the full splits before graduating high school is exhilarating to think about!

As for my man's splits, I'm making visible progress. Though not as close to the full splits as with the women's, I can feel the improvement in my joints and muscles. With continued practice, I'll certainly get much closer to my goal.

# No pain no gain
Before ending the reflection, I'd like to mention one more thing, which is pain. 

Stretching is a journey of pain and progress. The discomfort during the stretch is one thing, but the aftermath—when you try to stand up—is a whole different sensation. It's peculiar, almost like a different kind of wound, yet oddly fulfilling. Finding the right words to describe it is a challenge, but it's undeniably true.

For me, the soreness after stretching is a sign of accomplishment, much like the soreness after a good workout. But with stretching, there's a unique satisfaction. You feel longer, almost elongated, and your walk might resemble that of a penguin. Strangely enough, the intensity of this post-stretch pain seems more pronounced after working on the man's splits. It leaves me curious about the mechanics behind it all. 

These nuanced sensations of pain and progress add another layer to the journey toward achieving my splits, reminding me that each ache is a step closer to my goal.

# Optimistic outlook
No more beating around the bush—it's time for the real talk. I'm heading in the right direction, full speed ahead. Remember when I grumbled about not making much progress last time? Well, this time, it's a whole new ball game. I've pushed myself harder, and the results speak for themselves. The progress? Radical.

I'm eager to keep this momentum going, to see where this journey takes me. The prospects? They look darn promising. So, I'll keep stretching, keep pushing those limits, and let's see what unfolds. The excitement is real, and I can't wait to witness it firsthand!

Catch you later, alligator!
