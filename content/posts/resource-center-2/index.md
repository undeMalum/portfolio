# Overview
The last update concerning the Resource Center dates back to [the beginning of 2023](/resource-center/) when I [introduced](/resource-center/#what-is-this-project-about) the project, [explained](/resource-center/#my-contribution) what I added, and [proposed](/resource-center/#plans-for-the-future) some future developments. If you have no clue of what I'm talking about or you need to refresh your memory, please feel free to open the previous post. However, if you do not have time or patience to do so, no worries, what I'm about to discuss is rather stragithforward and context-indepenedent, at least to some degree.

Either way, I'm glad you're here because there's a lot to write about. So have a comfortable sit and let's get started!

# Resources
## Websites
As outlined in the [Plans for the future](/resource-center/#plans-for-the-future) section of the last reflection, I wanted to add useful websites for studying Computer Science in IBDP. Under the following [link](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/resources/websites/), you can find how I did this. It's pretty much the same thing I did for the Youtube resource with the exception that, instead of referencing example videos under the channel description, I [embeded](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27342702) sites directly to the Resource Center so that the viewer can browse these sites without leaving the Center. 

Embeding looks like this:

<embed src="https://www.eduges.pl" style="width:800px; height: 400px;">

I used my school's website because: A) I can B) It is finally useful

Anyway, it is all I can say about the Websites resource. If you want to see more, go to the Center.

Admittedly, what's now there, may change in the future. Of course, the change won't not drastic. I'm rather talking about appending new website I'll discover or that will be sent to me - as was the case for [cs-ib](https://www.cs-ib.net) where it was my Computer Science teacher who showed my this beauty beacuse he used it to teach the Web Science option.

(cs-ib is also a very interesting option for those seeking a way to start with [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). Although it runs on a different website generator than my blog, I find it a worth-considering option).

## Presentations
The [Presentations](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/resources/presentations/) resource is something I came up with on the fly. I was scrolling through Reddit when I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/147memk/ib_computer_science_consequences_of_data_lost/) on the [IBO](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/) subreddit. A guy just shared a presentation about a random IBDP Computer Science course topic - [tests types](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing) - (actually, she/he made [several posts for different subjects](https://www.reddit.com/user/ibresourcedump/)) and it occured to me that presentation is where a lot of people learn from. The power of this realization was strengthened, when I saw his/her other posts - this time about [data loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loss) - and after I DMed him - unfrotunately I haven't received any meaningful response yet :disappointed_relieved:.  

I was also motivated by presentations I had from my Computer Science classes. After all, we did nothing, but presentations throughout the year, covering two whole options - Databases and Simulation and Modelling.

Therefore, even though I'm not a huge fun of this particular learning approach, I decided to extend resources with the Presentation resource, for the sake of others. Maybe someone will find it useful.

But here's the thing - this resource is rather poor, currently. I was able to include only one option (Simulation and Modelling) because I didn't create the presentations about Databases and couldn't share them with "everyone with the link." I will talk with my Computer Science teacher and the issue should be resolved. 

Nevertheless, it changes nothing because, even if the teaches grants me access to these presentations, I'll have only two options and two random subtopics for Paper 1. Indeed, it is not much, not to mention that this resource is visually unappealing (as is the whole website, but this one thing looks particularly ugly and boring). 

Overall, I'm sure that this resource will be improved one way or another over time. Now, it's waiting for feedback and more presentations.

# Minor improvements
## Internal Assessment
First and foremost, I added a [new thing](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/internal-assessment/examples-ia/) under the Internal Assessments section. This one is not very elaborate, but sufficient - it has a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9jMq1QUTjXrfnJXb2NIX3dfdkVkSUVxcDZ4c1VrcmRJOGt3NFpsR2djLVpFVlVFLW9ERk0?resourcekey=0-FmAF740icJJ0ZLwZH78smw) to a Google Drive with real and graded Computer Science Internal Assessments. This Drive has been created by a Canadian high school teacher - Mr. Wachs. I recomend visiting [his website](https://mrwachs.wordpress.com) as you can find a lot of good stuff there to learn Computer Science, even in IBDP.

Anyway, to view the IAs, you may need to request access. However, everyone who asks receives it so don't worry.

Any more than that, I deleted the Important dates subsection as it's unnecessary regarding the purpose of the website. Each school distributes deadlines differently, so putting the ones imposed by my school makes no sense.
