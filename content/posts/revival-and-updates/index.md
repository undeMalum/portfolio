# A Few Words of Explanation
If you've been following my posts, you might have noticed a pattern of increasingly long breaks, especially since the second half of 2023. But a *7-month gap*? That’s by far the longest pause yet (my last post, dated [here](/portfolio/posts/cas-final-reflection/), was that long ago).

That doesn't mean life stood still. Quite the opposite, in fact—I’ve had a lot on my plate. At times, it felt like I was barely keeping up, struggling to balance everything. But those challenges have brought me to where I am today, and this will inevitably influence the direction of this blog.

So, I see this post not just as a recap of the events that have unfolded or a reflection on those experiences, but also as an introduction to the new course and structure I have in mind for this space.

Without further ado, let’s dive into the reflective part of this update.

# Longest summer 
For many, finishing off final exams marks the end of their high school journey - they've done their best and now is the time to gather the fruits of their hard work in the form of the acceptance to their program and university of choice (hopefully). These people need to just wrap up a few formalities and they are good to start their summer.

However, that's the ideal, unachievable for many, including me.

That may sound like unjustified whining, but it's true. After being rejected by the US unis, I tried my shot at a few European. Choices were limited by money constraints and date (I received the rejection in March by which time many unis in, e.g. Netherlands had closed the application process).

Nevertheless, I was able to determine five options: the Sapienza University of Rome (Italy), the Technical University of Munich (Germnay), Poznan University of Technology, the University of Warsaw and the Jagiellonian University (all three in Poland). Now, I would like to go over all of them in the above order.

## Sapiezna
[The Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) is one of the most renowned technical universities in Italy. It offers several degrees in English, including the one that caught my interest: [Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://acsai.di.uniroma1.it).

The name of the degree is long, but it speaks for itself. After reviewing the syllabus, my belief in its relevance to my interests—broadly speaking, computer science—was only reinforced.

The application process itself was straightforward. I simply registered on Sapienza's online platform, paid the application fee, submitted my SAT scores, and asked my IB Coordinator to send my IBDP results electronically to the university. Then, it was just a matter of waiting for the acceptance list, which was released earlier than those of other universities I had applied to.

Unfortunately, I wasn't accepted. Even if I had been, though, finding an affordable place to live in Rome—considering the city's high cost of living—would have been a challenge.

## TUM
[The Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/) is one of the top universities globally and the best in Germany. The only downside is that German universities tend to prioritize their language, leaving limited options for studying in English.

However, after some research, I discovered two degrees at [Campus Heilbronn](https://chn.tum.de) that were somewhat aligned with my interests and offered mostly in English (though there’s more to that in a minute).

The first option was [Management and Data Science](https://chn.tum.de/study-programs/bachelor-in-management-and-data-science), which is conducted entirely in English (awesome!). However, the curriculum wasn’t quite what I was looking for. The program focuses heavily on management—about 70%—while only 30% covers data science, the part I found most relevant.

Luckily, there was another option: [Information Engineering](https://chn.tum.de/study-programs/bachelor-in-information-engineering). This degree is essentially a typical computer science program with some added management and economics courses—no big deal, maybe even an advantage. The catch? Not all of it was in English. While the computer science courses are conducted in English, some of the management and economics classes are partially taught in German.

As a result, one of the application requirements was a German A2 language certificate. That presented a big challenge for me, as I hadn’t studied German since my freshman year of high school. Worse yet, I had just one month between my final exams and the language test date. So, while I applied for the Management and Data Science program as a fallback, I decided to go all in and try for the A2 certificate.

The timeline was tight, but thanks to my prior experience with German, rigorous study, and the help of my high school’s German teacher (who let me join the sophomore introductory classes), I managed to obtain the certificate. It was a wild ride, but I pulled it off.

Now, you’d think everything was sorted, right? Well, there’s another hurdle when applying to German universities: getting your foreign high school diploma recognized.

Most German universities require foreign applicants to go through [uni-assist](https://www.uni-assist.de/en/). TUM uses the uni-assist services for generating something called the [VPD (Vorprüfungsdokumentation)](https://www.uni-assist.de/en/tools/glossary-of-terms/description/term/vorpruefungsdokumentation-vpd-preliminary-review-documentation/). Essentially, you submit documents related to your grades and final exam results to uni-assist, and if everything checks out, you receive a VPD, which translates your grades into the [German _Abitur_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abitur#Equivalent_high_school_graduation_certificate_in_other_countries) system. Then, you send the VPD to the university, which evaluates your application based on that.

The tricky part is that the VPD takes 3–4 weeks to process during the busy application season. If any documents are missing or something is incorrect, you’ll only find out after a month. To make matters worse, I received my IB results on July 6th, and the TUM application deadline was July 15th. I had to submit a declaration saying I had already applied for the VPD and would send it as soon as I received it. My VPD finally arrived near the end of June.

Thankfully, TUM processed my VPD quickly, and I received a response in just 3–4 days. I was even more fortunate because I didn’t have to participate in an interview (which is required depending on your final exam scores). But seriously, the waiting time? I’d heard rumors about German bureaucracy, but this was my first real encounter with it.

Things didn’t get any easier afterward. I had to send proof of insurance and handle several other tedious administrative tasks.

And to top it all off, I never ended up going. Despite sending around 50 messages to landlords in Heilbronn, I didn’t receive a single response regarding available housing.

Considering the effort I put in—not just meeting the admission requirements, but also wading through endless paperwork—it feels like the embodiment of the phrase, "all that work and nothing to show for it."
