# A few words of explanation
Well... If you look at the dates of my previous posts, you'll notice that I having longer breaks between posts was a standard, especially since the second half of the 2023. However, a *7-month gap* is a hell lot of longer than ever before (that's how long ago [the previous](/portfolio/posts/cas-final-reflection/) post is dated).

This doesn't mean though that nothing was happening in my life (develop further).

There's a number of factors that have a fair share in this state of the matters and I would like to quickly go over them. After that, I will describe a few changes regarding the structure of the blog that I'll introduce, but that's for later.

Now, jump straight into my excuses.

### Grinding over everything
For many, finishing off final exams marks the end of their high school journey - they've done their best and now is the time to gather the fruits of their hard work in the form of the acceptance to their program and university of choice. These people need to just wrap up a few formalities and they are good to start their summer.

However, that's the ideal, which is not for everyone, including me.

That may sound like unjustified whining, but it's true. After being rejected by the US unis, I tried my shot at a few European unis (choices were limited by money )

write about Germany (A2, VPD) and Poland (travels, disperse dates)

### Tiredness
4 rough years
no time to rest
grinding

### Low priority
Blog lost its priority due to not being a requirement (no external force to motivate me to write)

### Change the numbering of the posts, change tags, change the frequency of the posts
