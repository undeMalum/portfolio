# Back to the past
Recall from [the previous blog entry on IBlieve](/portfolio/posts/iblieve-3/) that my article on IB's Middle Years Programme was not yet published. Well, that has changed! You can now see the cover and first paragraph of this article in the cover of this post. If you're interested, you can also [read the full article](https://iblieve.org/unlocking-the-mystery-of-myp/) on IBlieve.

Now, more importantly, I'm back from my break, fully dedicated to finishing my IBDP work. I'm super excited to dive into the discussion about my work with IBlieve. Let's get started!

# Course of actions
On IBlieve, the Team Leads have recently focused on three series: "What's IB Like," "Overview," and "A Comprehensive Guide."

Due to this shift in focus and the fact that Math AA is one of my IBDP subjects, I was tasked with writing an overview and guide for this subject. However, I wasn't working alone—I was paired up with one of the rookie writers who joined us during the winter application process, which added another interesting element to the project.

My co-writer for this article happened to be a girl from Poland. This collaboration was enjoyable for two main reasons: firstly, we had the opportunity to write about Polish A (a subject we both have experience with, although we opted for Math AA), and secondly, it allowed me to use a different language on IBlieve for communication (not that I have any complaints about using English—it's just that I never expected to have this opportunity).

We divided the tasks between us, with me taking on 1) a brief overview of the subject's content, 2) a summary of the assessments, and 3) a teaser (now required for promotion by the Social Media Team, which you can see below).

and she tackled 1) the differences between HL and SL, where applicable, 2) tips and resources for success, and 3) the conclusion.

Working together was a refreshing experience, as I had never shared the writing of an article with anyone before.

The article is yet to be published.

# The battle for the topic
March had arrived, and it was time for me to select a new topic for my IBlieve article. This time, we were given the freedom to choose our own topic, with the only criteria being that it must be "relevant to the IB community" and something we are "very passionate about." I was thrilled at the prospect of finally writing about the Computer Science syllabus, a topic I had wanted to explore for quite some time. However, complications arose.

Firstly, the Computer Science course in the IBDP is undergoing a transition to a new syllabus. Despite my prior [notification of this change on the Resource Center and a brief description of the updates](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/general-information/oncoming-changes/) over a year ago, the new syllabus is still delayed indefinitely. It has been recently confirmed for the May 2027 cohort, but does not yet exist. This leaves me disappointed as  the last wave of students who would be using the current 10-year-old syllabus would graduate in November 2025, which makes describing the old syllabus useless. Therefore, my perfect topic seemed either pointless or unattainable.

Secondly, I considered writing about the Extended Essay (EE) in Computer Science. It seemed like a fitting choice as I had just completed my own EE in CS, going through the entire process of selecting a Research Question, gathering data, conducting research, and familiarizing myself with the assessment criteria and well-graded EE examples. However, the Team Leads expressed concerns that I was not yet in a position to offer tips on writing an EE in CS, as my EE had not been graded and the grade boundaries were unpredictable. This idea was also ruled out.

Next, I contemplated writing about the university application process in Poland. While it seemed similar to the issue with the EE, it was not quite the same. Despite not having personally gone through the process, I was well-informed about it through the experiences of many acquaintances. I knew all the ins and outs, and which Polish universities excelled in various fields. I had a hands-on understanding, having visited universities and knowing some professors. Despite my knowledge, I couldn't quite convince the Team Leads, who emphasized the need for practical experience.

Feeling a bit discouraged, I almost gave up. However, the Team Leads mentioned that if I couldn't come up with a more suitable topic, they would consider allowing me to write about university applications in Poland. Whether this promise held true or not was uncertain, but it led to a moment of realization.

I recalled a subject in the "Individuals and Societies" group that bore thematic similarities to Computer Science: Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS). Upon further research, I discovered that it had been revised, now named "Digital Society" starting from the May 2024 examination sessions. After several failed attempts to find the right topic, I saw the Digital Society course as a perfect middle ground between my desire to write about a CS-related topic and my current stage as a high school senior.

Thus, I decided to write an overview of the Digital Society course for my upcoming IBlieve article.

# Some more info
The drafts are due on March 27th. My final math IA draft is due on March 26th. I think I will manage because why the hell not? I can handle such challenges and do it as well as I can.

Choosing the right topic wasn't easy, but here I am. My high school journey is coming to an end. That's... quite a strange realization. High school felt like ages, and I've changed so much on so many levels that it gives me a headache. I'm in a place I would never have anticipated.

Today, I'm awaiting my MIT application decision. I'll probably see it tomorrow because it'll be published late at night, and most likely I'll be sleeping by then. But who knows? Maybe I'll get so stressed that I won't be able to fall asleep. I'm going to find out.

But until then, all I can do is wait and do my best. Cheers to all the good people of the world, and see you sometime later!
