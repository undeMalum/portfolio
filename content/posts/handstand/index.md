# Reason
In the description, I mentioned that I've been experimenting with handstands. It's something I've always wanted to learn, and now I'm finally giving it a try. While some consider it risky, I disagree. The worst-case scenario is I might go into the bridge position or perform a reverse somersault. So, no need to worryâ€”I'll be just fine.

On another note, I see this as a way to breathe new life into my YouTube channel, which had been inactive for about half a year. Not only do I lack the time for proper editing and recording, but, more importantly, I've realized that I don't find it extremely enjoyable. While it was interesting to try something more "professional," it didn't resonate with me. 

The good thing though, is that I could apply the skills I developed during my YouTube-making journey in my Computer Science Internal Assessment. Before that, I had neither the time nor the desire to learn even basic editing skills that would allow me to present software in a more exciting way than just a 10-minute video with no cuts. Moreover, I also incorporated this experience into my MIT application!

# Trying not to break the neck
Okay, but I drifted far away from the main topic, so let's get to it. I started practicing around 2 weeks ago. Back then, I couldn't stand even for a few seconds. I wouldn't even describe it as standing. Now, with some tips from my best mate, I have improved my abilities and can now stand on my hands for a quarter of a second! Just kidding, but it's still not particularly long.

In spite of this, I think I can still call it progress. After all, most folks are too afraid to even try. I have gone through some basic gymnastic education, so for me, it comes in a way naturally. Besides, I love trying, whatever it is. And the handstand is a great example of this.

# Still alive
Well, I guess I will keep trying until someone or something stops me indefinitely. Otherwise, I don't see how I could convince myself to give up. I sincerely enjoy the adrenaline shots it provides me. The only downside I see now is that my arms hurt sometimes. It has gotten better, but it's strange nonetheless.

That's all I had to share. You can check out my YouTube channel if you want, though I attached all the films here.

Have a good day!
