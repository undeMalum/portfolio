# Reason
As I wrote in the description, I've been playing with the handstand. It seems pretty cool and I always wanted to learn it and never could. For some, it's dangerous, but I strongly disagree. Really, what bad can happen? Worst case scenario I would go to the bridge position or do reverse somersault. That's it. So don't worry, I'll be doing just fine.

Anyway, I also treat it as a way to revive my YouTube channel that went to a halt to like half a year. I mean, not only do I have no time for proper editing and recording, but more importantly, I discovered that I don't find it extremely enjoyable. It was nice to try something more "professional," but I don't feel it. The good (actually, super good!) thing is that I could apply the skills I learned over the course of my YouTube-makin career in my Computer Science Internall Assessment. Prior to that I had no time nor desire to learn even basic editing skills. I also used it for my MIT application!!

# Trying not to break the neck
Okay, but I drifted far away from the main topic so let's get to it. I started practicing around 2 weeks ago. Then, I couldn't stand even a few seconds. I wouldn't even describe it as standing. Now, with some tips from my best mate, I have improved my abilities and now can stand on my hands for a quarter of a second! Just kidding, but it's still not particurarly long.

In spite of this, I think I can still call it a progress. After all, most of folks are too afraid to even try. I have gone through some basic gymnastic education so for me it comes, in a way, natural. Besides, I love trying, whatever it is. And handstand is a great example of this.

# Still alive
Well, I guess I will be trying until someone or something stops me indefinately. Otherwise, I don't see how I could convince myself to give up. I sincerely enjoy the shots of adrenaline it provides to me. The only downside I see now I that my arms hurt sometimes. I has gotten better, but it's strange nonetheless. 

That'll be all I had to share. You can check out my YouTube channel if you want, though I attached all the films here. 

Have a good day!
