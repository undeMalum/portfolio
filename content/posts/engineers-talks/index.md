# Speedy hello
Hey folks! Welcome back — and this time, after only a short break (**finally!**).

Today’s post isn’t something I had been planning for a long time (as is usually the case).  

Instead, it’s more of a spur-of-the-moment thing — especially because the event in question, **_Engineer’s Talks_**, wasn’t even announced until about a week before it happened!

Still, I got so excited that I simply had to share it with you here.

One talk in particular really sparked my enthusiasm — but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First things first: **What the heck *is* Engineer’s Talks?**

# Engineer’s Talks

[Engineer’s Talks](https://www.facebook.com/events/1842547673234533/) is an yearly event organized by the GHOST science club (you can read more about GHOST [here](/portfolio/posts/tox-setup/#ghost)).  

In short: during these events, senior students present their Bachelor’s Thesis projects related to AI. It’s a great opportunity for younger students interested in artificial intelligence to get inspired, discover new research areas, and get a realistic glimpse of the challenges they might face in their own future work.

_Engineer’s Talks_ have been around for a while now—this was actually the 3rd or 4th edition. In fact, some of this year's presenters mentioned being inspired by earlier editions when they were just starting out.

Pretty awesome to see how it's growing and gaining momentum!

## Talks overview
This year’s edition featured three talks, presented in the following order.  
(Quick note: I’m pulling this info from GHOST’s Discord announcement — it was missing a few author names, so apologies in advance if anyone is left out!)

**1.** Łukasz Sztukiewicz, et al.  
> **_DetoxAI: A Python Package for Debiasing Neural Networks_**

**2.** Weronika Zawadzka, Konstanty Kordas, Jędrzej Pacanowski (plus one more contributor not listed)  
> **_Integrative Analysis of Microarray Gene Expression Profiles and Machine Learning-Based Response Prediction in Inflammatory Bowel Disease_**

**3.** Jakub Binkowski, Benedykt Huszcza  
> **_Generowanie banerów reklamowych z wykorzystaniem algorytmów sztucznej inteligencji_**  
(ENG: _Generating Advertising Banners Using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms_)

Although all seemed interesting, the one that convinced me to actually join the event was the second one.

Let me explain why.

# Inflammatory diseases
As I outlined in the [About me](http://localhost:1313/portfolio/about/#some-background) page (relevant piece is more or less in the middle) and I have been mentioning in this blog, directly or indirectly, I have something called [juvenile idiopathic arthritis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374082) or more generally [ankylosing spondylitis](https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/ankylosing-spondylitis).

I'd like to avoid explaining what it is and how it affected me (you can find appriopriate links above), but the important thing is that those experiences prompted me to explore this disease further.

An example of such exploration is my IA in biology.
