# To begin with,
everything started at the end of the **previous school year (2021-2022)**. Our, current `CAS coordinator`, then `English teacher`, asked us if we would like to participate in an event, called [PoMocna Piątka run](https://www.facebook.com/PoMocnaPiatkaPoznan/). Some of us where keen to sign up, **including me.** 

**Next school year (2022-2023)** we were reminded of `that list` and `that event` and asked to confirm our choice. I turned out to be `the first student` to do so, therefore, I was asked to coordinate the whole operation at our school (GeS). **Everyone interested was directed to me.** What's more, I was given the essential data of the person responsible for the project itself - to `stay in touch` and `supervise`. I **exchanged several messages** with her as well as with my fellow students in order to make sure we **understood each other** correctly and to clarify **how we were supposed to help**. 

**The result was that**, on the day of the run (25th September), there were `two groups` of helpers for different periods (from 7:00am to 10:00am and from 10:00am to 1:00pm) `before` and `during` the run. I was in the earlier one, **but that's another story**.

# What thoughts popped to my mind?
To be honest, choosing to coordinate the whole "_enterprise_" was kind of natural for me. **I like trying new things.** Exposure to something different is always exciting for me, especially when I take a leading role. I love to take `responsibility`, to `plan meticulously`. The idea I could have a positive **impact on the way the events unfolded was very appealling**, even more as it was done for **the disadvantaged people**. Maybe it is "another brick in the wall" of **the global-scale problem,** but what a `satisfactory brick` that is! So that was fun for me. 

**On the other hand,** I inevitably had to face `managing people` and `dealing with the annoyance` of trying to get information from them. But it's just a part of the role I chose, I supppose. **That's all I had to share in this context.**
