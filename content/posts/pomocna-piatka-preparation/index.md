# To begin with,
everything started at the end of the **previous school (2021-2022)**. Our, currently `CAS co-ordinator`, then `English teacher`, asked us if we would like to participate in an event, called [PoMocna Piątka run](https://www.facebook.com/PoMocnaPiatkaPoznan/). Some of us where keen to sign up, **including me.** 

**Next school year (2022-2023)** we were remainded of `that list` and `that event` and asked to confirm our choice. I turned out to be `the first student` to do so, therefore I was proposed to co-ordinate the whole operation in terms of our school (GeS). **Everyone iterested was directed to me.** What's more, I was given essential data of the person responsible for the project itself - to `stay in touch` and `supervise`. I **exchanged several messages** with her as well as with my fellow students in order to make sure we **understand each other** correctly and that our **way of helping is clear**. 

**The result was that**, in the day of the run (25th September), there were `two groups` for different periods (from 7:00am to 10:00am and from 10:00am to 1:00pm) `before` and `during` the run. I was in the earlier one, but that's the other story.

# What thoughts popped to my mind?
To be honest, choosing to coordinate the whole "_enterprise_" was kinda naturall for me. **I like trying new things.** Exposure to something different is alway exting for me, especially in **a leading role**. I love to take `responsibility`, to `plan` meticulously. The idea I could have a positive **impact on the way the events unfolded was brilliant**, even more so doing it for **the disadvantaged people**. Maybe it is "another brick in the wall" of **the global-scale problem,** but a `satisfactory` one! So that was a fun part to me. 

**On the other hand,** I had to inevitably face managing people and following **the annoyance of trying to get information from them.** But it's just a part of the role I chose, I supppose. That's all I had to share in this context.
