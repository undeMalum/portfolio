# Welcome to my activity section!
Here, I will introduce **everything** I do as a physical exercise. This includes: `football`, `workout` and `stretching`.

# Football
My journey with football isn't so straightforward. I started hating it, but ended up loving it. Now it's a great way to wind down and make friendships! By the way, my position is a goalkeeper and favourite club is Manchester United.

# Workout
The title can be misleading as I don't mean hardcore physical activity. In this category, I wanna put everything that keeps my body healthy, no matter whether its about abs, doing legs or riding a bike.

# Stretching
Stretching is a new level of exercising. It not only improves your result, but also helps you prevent awful pain in places like nake, back, knees etc. It helps your body to regenerate.
