# But first,
let me provide some background of myself. I attend [Private High School Gaudium et Studium](https://edu-ges.pl/high-school/about-school) in Poznań that offers [IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/) (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme). It wasn’t my first choice though as I started in football class. However, I was quickly forced to change my mind due to a disease, namely [`juvenile idiopathic arthritis`](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374082). Fortunately, I really enjoy the place where I am now and I can’t think of a more suitable environment!

# Nonetheless,
`football` is still my great passion, even though it didn’t use to be. **I hated running** so I hated football. Not that I had bad stamina. I just didn’t like the mere fact of running, that's all. Instead, I participated in a variety of other sports over the years. The first one ever was `karate`. It consumed **whole 7 years of my earliest childhood** and helped me to develop flexibility as well as self-rigor. In the meantime, each year, during the winter break, I have been `skiing` and **this continues to this day**. Besides football, I consider these two to be my favorite sports, with which I have best memories. However, I didn't restricted myself to these activities. I also played `tennis`, danced `hip-hop`, did `gymnastic` a bit, rode a `scooter` (a modern skateboard in a way) and I could go on forever.

# Logical thinking is
what interests me as well. I'm a **mathematically- and algorithmically-oriented person** and I find fulfillment in `mathematics` and `computer science`. Don't get me wrong, I don't fall under the stereotypical "nerd" category. I don't spend a vast majority of my time starring at the computer, struggling to develop deeper bonds with people. I value the proximity of others and I exhibit extreme extravert behaviors. It’s just that I’m appealed by **the beauty of mathematics and the power of computers**. Although I’ve said I'm more of a science guy, I also enjoy other fields like textual analysis or history (especially the one written by `Manchester United`). **I’m simply curious** and everything that’s considered "_knowledge_" is exciting for me and I want to explore it as thoroughly as I can!

# I believe,
I've introduced myself properly, so that you know what to expect from this website! I recommend you have a look at [my projects](/portfolio/projects) if you're interested in programming. Also, I run a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaFx3UdgaiBVbJQBZsR9x-Q) so you can check that one as well!
