# Hello World!
I'm Mateusz Konat—a tech enthusiast, sportsman, wit, and lifelong learner.

Here, you'll discover more about me and my activities, explore [my blog](/portfolio/posts), and dive into [my projects](/portfolio/projects).

Also, you can easily navigate through the content of interest on my website using the tags at the top of each page (indicated by "#" sign like "#my projects" or "#creativity").

Now, let me tell you more about myself!

# Some Background

In September 2024, I started my Bachelor's degree in [Artificial Intelligence]() at [Poznań University of Technology]().

Earlier that year, I also graduated from [Private High School Gaudium et Studium](https://www.eduges.pl/en), where I completed the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme ([IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/)). Naturally, my higher-level subjects were `computer science`, `mathematics`, and `English`.

_If you're interested, you can check out my work from that time in the [IB resources](/portfolio/ib-resources) section._

Anyway, I know this all paints a bit of a techy/nerdy picture, right? But my journey wasn’t always a **Silicon Valley** kind of story.

I actually began high school in a **football class**, which surprised those who knew me as a computer and math whiz. Turns out, I have always had a bit of sportsmanship in me. 

Unfortunately, my path took an even more unexpected turn when I had to leave the football due to a condition called [juvenile idiopathic arthritis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374082). This condition led me to become, quite reluctantly, a **collector of inflammations** and, more importantly, _ended my chances of becoming a next Szczęsny_.

Despite this setback, **the choices I made after leaving the football class**, _particularly enrolling in the IBDP_, **turned out to be some of the best decisions of my life**. They nurtured my curiosity, increased my appetite for knowledge, and helped me grow into a better person.

Life throws random challenges at us, but my experiences have shown me that unexpected turns aren’t always bad.  

Now that we’ve got the overly philosophical part out of the way, let's move on to my **interests**.

# My Inner World
As implied, I'm a **mathematically- and algorithmically-oriented person**, finding deep fulfillment in `mathematics` and `computer science` (see [Programming and Creativity](/portfolio/creativity) page).

While I don't consider myself a stereotypical "nerd," I do embrace my nerdy side, especially when delving into these areas. **The precision of mathematics and the creative power of computers** captivate me, drawing me into their intricate worlds.

I'm also someone who sets clear goals and works tirelessly to achieve them—a trait shaped largely by my sports background (more on that later). I believe this determination is essential for solving the complex problems encountered in both math and computer science.

In addition, I value social interactions and sometimes exhibit strong extroverted behaviors (_and I mean it_). This willingness to collaborate is invaluable in my pursuit of math and computer science, as both fields involve significant social interaction, contrary to popular belief.

Beyond these symbol- and notation-oriented areas, I also have a keen interest in `biology`, particularly `bioinformatics`. This subfield aligns well with my interests since it involves massive amounts of data where computers are indispensable. Additionally, I have a natural curiosity about how things work.

Despite being more of a science enthusiast, I also enjoy other fields like `history`. Whether it's exploring Japanese expansion into China in the 1930s or Manchester United's golden era under Sir Alex Ferguson, I'm fascinated by diverse topics. Overall, I'm simply curious and eager to explore everything considered "_knowledge_" as thoroughly as possible!

Furthermore, as you might have guessed, I have always been an enthusiastic sportsman.

# A Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body
As mentioned, participating in various sports has been a long-standing tradition for me.

`Football`, for instance, remains a great passion of mine, even though I can no longer play at an advanced level (see [Some Background](#some-background)). I enjoy improving my skills with the ball each day, finding a touch of magic in every moment.

However, my first and most impactful sport was `karate`. It consumed **seven years of my earliest childhood** and shaped my personality to an incredible degree. Karate developed my proficiency in gymnastics, injury recovery, and body awareness. 

Through enduring physical challenges during practices and learning from tournament losses, it also instilled in me a philosophy of hard work, perseverance, and a healthy acceptance of failure. Consistent improvement and goal-focused training enhanced my confidence in overcoming obstacles and fostered a sense of competitiveness. 

All of this thanks to just one sport.

During winter breaks, I also indulged in `skiing`. Although not always possible due to its expense, I seized every opportunity to explore the slopes and enjoy the experience immensely.

Besides football, karate, and skiing are my favorite sports, bringing me the best memories. However, I haven't limited myself to just these activities. I've also played `tennis`, danced `hip-hop`, dabbled in `gymnastics`, and rode a `scooter` (a modern skateboard of sorts), among others.

In essence, I love sports and couldn't live without them. The types of sports I engage in might have changed (see [Activity](/portfolio/activity) page), but I'm always active. Yet, there is one more think I'd like to briefly mention.

# In Service to Others
Apart from being deeply engaged in learning and sports, I am also a `proud volunteer` (see [Service](/portfolio/service) page).

In primary school, volunteer work wasn't highly promoted. There were occasional "workshops," but these were infrequent and limited in scope. Additionally, few people in my immediate circle were involved in volunteer activities.

It wasn't until the middle of high school that I truly began to appreciate and immerse myself in volunteer work. My journey started when I decided to participate in a summer camp organized by the Bury Mis Foundation (see more [here]()). This experience sparked a passion for service, and from that point on, volunteering became an essential part of my life. 

I got involved in [organizing various festivities](/portfolio/posts/pomocna-piatka-preparation/) and [workshops](/portfolio/posts/druzyna-szpiku/), [expanded my engagement](/portfolio/posts/selling-cheese/) with the Bury Mis Foundation, and even [received an honorable mention](/portfolio/posts/poznanski-wolontariusz-roku/) at the Poznań Volunteer of the Year 2023 competition for my contributions!

Admittedly, I had to slow down since my senior year of high school. However, despite that—and despite the shift in the type of volunteer work I do since enrolling in the university—_I still find volunteer work immensely fulfilling_.
