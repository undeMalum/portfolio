# But first,
let me provide some background of myself. I attend [High School Gaudium et Studium](https://edu-ges.pl/high-school/about-school) in Poznań that offers [IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/) (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme). It wasn’t my first choice though as I started in football class. However, I was forced to change my mind and place due to disease, namely [`juvenile idiopathic arthritis`](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374082). Fortunately, I really enjoy the place where I am now and I can’t think of more suitable environment!

# Nonetheless,
 `football` is still my great passion, even though I didn’t use to be. **I hated running** so I hated football. Not that I had bad stamina, just I didn’t like the fact of running. Instead, I participated in a variety of activities. First and foremost is `karate`. It took **7 years of my earliest childhood** and helped me to develop flexibility as well as self-rigor. In the meantime, each year, during the winter break, I have been `skiing` and more importantly **this continues to this day**. Besides football, these two I consider as my favorite sports and have best memories. Then, I was playing `tennis`, `dancing hip-hop`, `doing gymnastic` a bit and `riding a scooter` (skatepark and stuff) and many, many other stuff but not as "_professionally_".

# What do I enjoy apart from physical activity?
 Well, I'm a **mathematically and algorithmically-oriented person** so obviously `mathematics` and informatics (`computer science`). Ever since, I was a kind of nerd, but I wouldn’t call myself “nerdy”. I don’t have problems with relationships and so on. It’s just I’m appealed by **the logic and beauty of mathematics and the power of the computer**. Although I’ve said I'm more of a scientific mind, I also enjoy other fields like textual analysis or history (especially the one written by `Manchester United`). **I’m simply curious** and everything that’s considered "_knowledge_" is exciting for me and I want to explore as much as I can!

# I believe,
I've `introduced myself` properly, so that you know `what to expect` from this website! I recommend you have a look at [my projects](/portfolio/projects) if you're interested in programming. Also, I run a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaFx3UdgaiBVbJQBZsR9x-Q) so you can check that one as well!
