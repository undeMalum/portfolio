My name is Mateusz Konat and I hope you’re gonna enjoy my website (also used as CAS portfolio)! 

But firstly let me provide some background of myself. I attend [High School Gaudium et Studium](https://edu-ges.pl/high-school/about-school) in Poznań that offers [IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/) (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme). It wasn’t my first choice though as I started in football class. However, I was forced to change my mind and place due to disease, namely juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Fortunately, I really enjoy the place where I am now and I can’t think of more suitable environment!

Nonetheless, football is still my great passion, even though I didn’t use to be. I hated running so I hated football. Not that I had bad stamina, just I didn’t like the fact of running. Instead, I participated in a variety of activities. First and foremost is karate. It took 7 years of my earliest childhood and helped me to develop flexibility as well as self-rigor. In the meantime, each year, during the winter break, I have been skiing and more importantly this continues to this day. Besides football, these two I consider as my favorite sports and have best memories. Then, I was playing tennis, dancing hip-hop, doing gymnastic and riding a scooter (skatepark and stuff) and many, many other stuff but not as ‘’professionally”. 

What do I enjoy apart from physical activity? Well, mathematically and algorithmically-oriented person so obviously mathematics and informatics (computer science). Ever since, I was a kind of nerd, but I wouldn’t call myself “nerdy”. I don’t have problems with relationships. It’s just I’m appealed by the logic and beauty of mathematics and the power of computers. Although I’ve said I more a scientific mind, I also enjoy other fields like textual analysis or history. I’m simply curious and everything that’s considered ‘’knowledge” is exciting for me and I want to explore as much as I can!
