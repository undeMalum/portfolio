## Computer Science  

The **Computer Science IA** is unique—it requires both **a working program** and **detailed documentation** covering every step, from planning to final review.  

The final submission is a website that includes:  
- The **full documentation**  
- The **program’s source code**  
- Supporting documents in an **appendix**  

### How I’m Sharing My IA  
Instead of a **PDF**, I’m uploading the entire website (except for two things):  

1. **Source Code** – I won’t upload it directly, but I’ll share a **GitHub link** to the version submitted for IA. *(I later updated the code, but the IA version remains available.)*  
2. **Video Demonstration** – Instead of a lengthy file, I’ll provide a **YouTube link** showcasing the final product.  

This setup mirrors what an examiner would see while keeping things practical.  

For a complete reference, check out **[this website](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/)**—it has everything you need!
