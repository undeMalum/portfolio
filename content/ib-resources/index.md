# Intro  
Hello everyone!  

This section is mainly for **first- and second-year IB students** looking for examples of IAs, TOK essays, or EEs.  

However, if you're curious about these essays but unfamiliar with the abbreviations, check out this [Reddit Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/wiki/everythingaboutib/)—a great starting point with explanations and useful resources.  

Feel free to explore and analyze these works however you like!

# Info & Structure  

Here’s a quick guide to this page’s structure and content.  

### My IB Subjects  

**Higher Level:**  
- `Computer Science`, `Mathematics: Analysis & Approaches`, `English B`  

**Standard Level:**  
- `Polish A`, `History`, `Biology`  

The next section is divided into eight parts: one for each subject listed above, plus **TOK** and **EE**.  

Each section includes:  
- **Title** of the work  
- **Word/Page count**  
- **Additional details** _(as per IB requirements)_ 
- **Grade received or expected** _(Grad for the work, not the subject)_  
- **PDF link** to the work  

With that, everything should be clear—enjoy exploring!

# IB Works  

## TOK  
TOK grading consists of two parts: **TOK Essay** (⅔ of the final grade) and **TOK Exhibition** (⅓ of the final grade). This section is divided accordingly.  

**Final Grade:** A  

### TOK Exhibition  
- **Title:** TOK Exhibition: Knowledge & Technology 
- **Theme:** Knowledge & Technology  
- **Prompt:** Is bias inevitable in the production of knowledge? (Prompt 11)  
- **Word Count:** 920  
- **PDF:** [TOK Exhibition](./files/mk_final_tok_exhibition2.pdf)

### TOK Essay
- **Title:** Theory of Knowledge Essay
- **Areas of Knowledge:** Mathematics, Natural Sciences
- **TOK Essay Question:** 2. How can we reconcile the opposing demands for specialization and generalization in the production of knowledge? Discuss with reference to mathematics and one other area of knowledge.
- **Word Count:** 1,596
- **PDF:** [TOK Essay](./files/tok_essay_final.pdf), [TK/PPF](./files/TKPPF_en%201.pdf)

- **Topic:** The Transformer architecture in common sense inference
- **Research Question:** To what extent is the state-of-the-art language model architecture Transformer accurate in commonsense inference tasks?
- **Word Count:** 3,941
- **PDF:** [Extended Essay](./files/ee_final.pdf), [EE/RPPF](./files/EERPPF_en.pdf)

## Computer Science  

The **Computer Science IA** is unique—it requires both **a working program** and **detailed documentation** covering every step, from planning to final review.  

The final submission is a website that includes:  
- The **full documentation**  
- The **program’s source code**  
- Supporting documents in an **appendix**  

Instead of submitting a **PDF**, I have provided **a hosted website** on GitHub.  

Some internal aspects of the website had to be adjusted for seamless hosting. However, _your experience browsing this version of my CS IA should be identical to that of a real submission._  

For a complete list of modifications, please read **[this README](https://github.com/undeMalum/internal-assessment/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cs-internal-asessment)**.  

For a more comprehensive overview of the CS IA, check out **[this website](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/)**—it has everything you need!  

### Details  
**Grade:** ~7  

- **Title:** CAS Manager  
- **Word Count:** 1,994  
- **Link:** [Internal Assessment](https://undemalum.github.io/internal-assessment/)

## Math AA

**Grade:** ~7

- **Title:** Stability Analysis of Rectangular Ribbed Plates
- **Page Count:** 18
- **PDF:** [Internal Assessment](./files/mk_ia_final.pdf)

---

## English B  

_English B is an oral exam where you cannot prepare responses in advance_.

Instead, you must rely on your knowledge of the required books and the possible themes or issues they explore. You will be given an extract and must deliver a presentation, followed by answering a series of questions on various aspects of the text and more.

For more details, refer to the [subject guide](https://www.cosmopolitanschool.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dp-language-B-guide.pdf).

## Biology

**Grade:** ~6

- **Title:** Inferring the possibility of ankylosing spondylitis occurrence based on the clade of HLA-B27
phylogenetic tree for the European population
- **Page Count:** 11
- **PDF:** [Internal Asessment](./files/ia_bio_final.pdf)

---

## History

**Grade:** ~7

- **Research Question:** To what extent was the contribution of three Polish mathematicians–Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski, and Jerzy Różycki–crucial for breaking the Enigma machine?
- **Word Count:** 2,035
- **PDF:** [Internal Assessment](./files/mk_ia_history_final.pdf)

## Polish A  

The Internal Assessment in Polish A (or any language in the **Language and Literature** version) is also an **Oral Assessment**. However, unlike English B, it requires a presentation that you **can** and even **should** prepare in advance—*words of my Polish A teacher of 20 years, not mine.*  

Although the final grading is based on a **voice recording** of the presentation along with follow-up questions, I will upload:  
- The **text draft** of my presentation, which I wrote to prepare myself  
- My **notes**  
- The **book excerpt** on which my presentation was based  

Unfortunately, I cannot upload the recording of my IA, as my teacher preferred to avoid potential repercussions from sharing my work publicly (*paraphrasing her words here*).  

That said, despite this limitation, you can still benefit from the following resources.
