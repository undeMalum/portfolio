## Computer Science  

The **Computer Science IA** is unique—it requires both **a working program** and **detailed documentation** covering every step, from planning to final review.  

The final submission is a website that includes:  
- The **full documentation**  
- The **program’s source code**  
- Supporting documents in an **appendix**  

Instead of submitting a **PDF**, I have provided **a hosted website** on GitHub.  

Some internal aspects of the website had to be adjusted for seamless hosting. However, _your experience browsing this version of my CS IA should be identical to that of a real submission._  

For a complete list of modifications, please read **[this README](https://github.com/undeMalum/internal-assessment/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cs-internal-asessment)**.  

For a more comprehensive overview of the CS IA, check out **[this website](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/)**—it has everything you need!  

### Details  
**Grade:** ~7  

- **Title:** CAS Manager  
- **Word Count:** 1,994  
- **Link:** [Internal Assessment](https://undemalum.github.io/internal-assessment/)
