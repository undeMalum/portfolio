# The idea behind
The idea that software should be `shared` and `freely accessible` for everyone lies at the core of programming. Sharing software allows individuals to learn from the experience of others, to avoid common mistakes and consequently - to write software faster and better, advancing our understanding of the world. Therefore, I, allowing others to learn and learning by myself, want to share my [Github](https://github.com/undeMalum) with those interested in changing our lives!

# My projects
- [My headquarters and CAS portfolio](https://github.com/undeMalum/portfolio)
