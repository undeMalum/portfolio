## Investigation
There was a widespread complain about the school building's design. More specifically, people regarded it as boring (and they still do). But how could they otherwise describe a bunch of squares and rectangles filled merely with white color and shades of grey? Exactly...

We wanted to come across this disappointment and beautify the school a bit. With the help of our CAS coordinator, we cooked **the idea of interior design** of the sorts. Our aim was to prepare various decorations for different occasions and hence make the building more interesting.

## Preparation
First and foremost, our project required determining what events are worth decorating school for. Some answers were straightforward - Christmas and Easters were must since they are multinational celebrations. It was Poland-specific holidays that were problematic. For example, there was a question whether we should focus on All Saints' Day or Halloween. However, because one of our school's aim is to be as international as possible (we are in _International_ Baccalaureate after all), we decided to keep with more global events such as Halloween.

Another advantage of our project was that we didn't have to outline a long-term plan for our actions and split roles explicitly. All we needed to do was to set a specific date and deliver our part of decorations (didn't matter - handmade or bought). Everyone could do whatever they wished, therefore, there was a lot of space for imagination and creativity (about which more in the [Reflection](#reflection) section).

## Action
As mentioned, although events were different, course of action was rather repetitive. As an event was approaching, our leader would remind us about our duty and kindly encourage us to start thinking and preparing decorations. Usually, some propositions inspired by Pinterest, TikTok and so would emerge in our group chat so that we could choose decorations that were the most appealing to us. 

Basically, we had a chance to do whatever we wanted as long us we could deliver it on time. Fortunately for those who struggle with deadlines, there was a lot of flexibility and if you didn't manage to bring anything at specific time, you could make it for the next day.

After enough decorations were gathered, we could start hanging them around the school (using tape and scissors).

## Reflection
Once again in the IBDP, I had an amazing opportunity to try something new that I would have never picture myself doing. At the end of the day, how often do students decorate schools? Once, twice a year at most. Besides, there was no censorship imposed on our choices of knick-knacks, which was great! Of course, had we done something highly inappropriate, it would have certainly been reported, but it was not the case and everyone enjoyed our efforts.

As far as I'm personally concerned, I liked the idea of creation. Much as in programming, with the interior design I could create new and innovative things. Moreover, I had a chance to work on my manual craftsmanship which went a bit rusty since the last time I could use it.

Admittedly, sometimes it was hard to get people have their things done - especially at later stages. However, they eventually did their work and the effect was outstanding.

Overall, I believe it was a fantastic journey and I highly recommend that other classes would continue on our project (even though, we - the initial authors - may be too overwhelmed with senior year's deadlines and uni applications).

## Demonstration
Our demonstration was ongoing, that is, you could see the results for each event separately - Christmas, Halloween, Easters etc. Together, they constitute our *final outcome of the project*.
