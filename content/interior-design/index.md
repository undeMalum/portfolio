## Investigation
There was a widespread compalain about the school building's design. More specifically, people regarded it as boring (and they still do). But how could they otherwise describe a bunch of squares and recatngles filled just with white and shades of grey? Exactly...

We wanted to come acroos this disappointment and beautify the school a bit. With the help of our CAS co-ordinator, we cooked the idea of intetior design of the sorts. Our aim was to prepare various decorations for different occasions and hence make the building more interesting.
