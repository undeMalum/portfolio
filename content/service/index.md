# Welcome to my servie section
Here, I will present **everything** I do voluntary, serving others. This includes: [`the foundation of Bury Miś`](/portfolio/service/#bury-miś), [`teaching`](/portfolio/service/#teaching) and [`temporary events`](/portfolio/service/#temporary-events).

# Bury Miś
**Description:**<br>
[The foundation of Bury Miś](https://buremisie.org.pl) is a `charity`, aiming to help `disabled people` - **both physically and intelectually**. The charity was **found in 1983 in Cracow**, but moved to `Nowy Klincz` 9 years later. My contribution here is serving as a `counselor` during **camps organized for disabled**, `meeting with my charges` throughout the yeat ans occasionally selling `hand-made Kashubian chesse`.

# Teaching
**Description:**<br>
You're right! I also `teach other people`. I **understand concepts** and I'm **keen to explain them**, if **someone struggles** to do it. I teach mainly `math` and `computer science` because that's what **interests me the most**. So if you have problems with certain material, I can help `you understand` it.

# Temporary events
**Description:**<br>
This section is dedicated to **all things** I `do voluntary`, but are `one-time-only`. Although such events require `planning`, `commitment` and simply - `much effort`, they **occur once** and **won't repeat in the near future**. For example, the upcoming run called [PoMocna Piątka](https://www.facebook.com/PoMocnaPiatkaPoznan/) that happens on **25th of September, 2022**.
