      <description>The crew and the plan Every good plan starts with a good idea and a reliable crew, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? The salt dough workshops began exactly like this. It was an ordinary winter day (winter because of the month, not the weather) that a fellow volunteer came up with a thought of crafting something original for ≈öwiƒôtnica at Osada, Kaszuby, which ends the holidays. Another individual suggested salt dough for this noble cause as it is one of these kids-love-playing-with magical substances that leaves a lot of space for imagination (and mess naturally, but who cares?</description>

      <description>What on earth is going on? Christmas&amp;hellip; WHAT?! X-MAS cup 2022 was a tournament for all young players from Lech Pozna≈Ñ Football Academies (LFPA) no matter where they were located1. The director of LFPA, Dominik Czapczyk, describes this series of events as follows:
&amp;ldquo;Annual X-MAS Cups are both a big thank-you to LFPA players for their hard work and place to simply hang out.&amp;rdquo; üéÖ ‚öΩ
As you can see, the underlying aim was priceless; at the end of the day, what values the most is a child&amp;rsquo;s smile.</description>

      <description>What a day it was! After spending a marvelous night at a gig dedicated to Pink Floyd history with my grandpa, brother and friend, I had to wake up at 5:00a.m.! This is because I decided to reach the destination by bike. Compared to a combustion-engine-powered car or bus, a bike is arguably the most eco-friendly means of transport (and considerably less outside-world-dependent) hence my choice. Nonetheless, there were nearly 20km to be travelled and no time to be wasted.</description>

      <description>To begin with, everything started at the end of the previous school year (2021-2022). Our, current CAS coordinator, then English teacher, asked us if we would like to participate in an event, called PoMocna PiƒÖtka run. Some of us where keen to sign up, including me.
Next school year (2022-2023) we were reminded of that list and that event and asked to confirm our choice. I turned out to be the first student to do so, therefore, I was asked to coordinate the whole operation at our school (GeS).</description>
