      <description>Time capsule In the description of this blog post, I emphasized the significance of my interactions with my charges. It might be surprising for those who glance at my portfolio and notice that the last reflection on this topic dates back to October of last year!
While I don&amp;rsquo;t have a groundbreaking explanation, I simply directed my reflections towards other matters during that period, and nothing unusual occurred to prompt a new entry.</description>

      <description>A simple catch-up As I underlined in the description of this beautiful blog post, an ongoing commitment to an activity earns you respect and trust. In the life of mine, the most resonating and continuous pastime is meeting my lovely charges. Therefore, it is unfortunate that my bulging holiday schedule made those meetings impossible.
Nevertheless, school year has been bringing me to Poznań every day of the workweek, which obviously facilities commuting to my charges and turns me into their frequent visitor - not all of them, much to my disappointment, but more on this later.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer The presentation (actually, a series of presentations) I would like to talk about happend at the end end of 2022-2023 school year. Therefore, it begs a question why the report is being written so late? Well, I was simply busy and had no time - at the end of the day part-time job, plus internships consumes a lot of my time.
However, I have finally found a free period in my schedule and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to catch up with the updates.</description>

      <description>Let mercy come and wash away
Linkin Park Before Each time I type these two commands in the Terminal:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hugo new posts/{name_of_reflection}/index.md &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; mkdir content/posts/{name_of_reflection}/images I know I am going to spend next 1 or 2 hours polishing my newly-created blog post. I do not complain, no way! I happily do all I can to deliver the best possible reader experience. I prefer quality over quantity such that I can highlight what is the most important in my reflections.</description>

      <description>The crew and the plan Every good plan starts with a good idea and a reliable crew, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? The salt dough workshops began exactly like this. It was an ordinary winter day (winter because of the month, not the weather) that a fellow volunteer came up with a thought of crafting something original for Świętnica at Osada, Kaszuby, which ends the holidays. Another individual suggested salt dough for this noble cause as it is one of these kids-love-playing-with magical substances that leaves a lot of space for imagination (and mess naturally, but who cares?</description>

      <description>A quick pill of essentials In the past few months, I have participated in a number of new service activities that consumed most of my time devoted to this blog/portfolio. In fact, the last reflection dedicated to my boys (Piotr, Maciej and Adam) dates back to November 2022! As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s the high time I come back with a refreshed set of experiences and thoughts that have hit me.</description>

      <description>A Short Story About Bury Miś And Cheese Seemingly, the Bury Miś Foundation is only a typical organization where enthusiastic volunteers attempt to make life of the disadvantaged more enjoyable. Indeed, it provides social interaction and support to people who are in a strong need of the company of others and struggle to develop bonds with society, which is worthy of admiration. However, what does differ the Bury Miś Foundation from other similar organizations is its complexity.</description>

      <description>A glimpse into my work I regularly meet with all my &amp;ldquo;Bears&amp;rdquo;1 from the camp - Piotr, Marcin, and Adam. Since there are three of them, I visit each tri-weekly (usually). This is also due to logistic reasons. They live all across Poznań. Commuting unavoidably consumes much of my time and, although I get to know new places (like a cozy café in Wilda district!) which is fine, sadly I can&amp;rsquo;t pay them visits more often.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my servie section Here, I will present everything I do voluntarily, serving others. This includes: the foundation of Bury Miś, teaching and temporary events.
Bury Miś Description: The foundation of Bury Miś is a charity, aiming to help disabled people - both physically and intelectually. The charity was found in 1983 in Cracow, but moved to Nowy Klincz 9 years later. My contribution here is serving as a counselor during camps organized for the disabled, meeting with my charges throughout the year and occasionally selling hand-made Kashubian chesse.</description>
