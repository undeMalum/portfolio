      <description>Up to speed There&amp;rsquo;s a noticeable gap between this reflection and the previous one, mainly due to the mock exams that consumed much of my time in the past 2-3 weeks. This, coupled with other blog topics and life events, delayed this update.
Before diving into my progress on the splits, I want to clarify a couple of things mentioned in previous posts:
Firstly, the handstand series has been abandoned. I grew tired of explaining its safety and many concerns about potential injuries.</description>

      <description>In a rush I confess, the only reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this particular reflection is to wrap up this month&amp;rsquo;s activity and dive into creativity and service. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a change of heart about sports—definitely not! It&amp;rsquo;s just that there&amp;rsquo;s not much progress to share, almost nothing if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest. I simply want to get this over with.
The urgency comes from some changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made to the Resource Center and a new charge at Bury Mis that I&amp;rsquo;m excited to talk about.</description>

      <description>Warm up I&amp;rsquo;ve started replacing dump cover pictures of me doing the splits. The exact reasons are not important. But it&amp;rsquo;s not why you&amp;rsquo;re here so let&amp;rsquo;s go straight to the point.
Just one thing&amp;hellip; Pictures in this section were taken during only one stretching section. You now the reason, but I just wanted to let you know. They are representative though, so they should suffice. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s see what&amp;rsquo;s up, at last.</description>

      <description>Intro real quick I have already discussed extensively problems with documenting my progress so I won&amp;rsquo;t be talking about it here. All I want to do here is sum up how much more (hopefully) my muscles have become flexible.
Focus is the key one would argue.
The socks look professional, don&amp;rsquo;t they?
Muscles extension The title is misleading as my muscles are not longer, but can be stretched more. As always, it is not easy to measure how exactly I progressed.</description>

      <description>Excuse On September 28th, 2022, I published my first reflection concerning my adventure with the splits, which is quite some time ago. I have postponed the release of another reflection for a couple of reasons.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s annoying to take photos while stretching because you can&amp;rsquo;t just painlessly stand up (it hurts very badly, believe me) to grab your phone. Without any photos there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence of my progress and with no evidence it&amp;rsquo;s meaningless to even start writing a reflection.</description>

      <description>A brief summary Having read the &amp;ldquo;About me&amp;rdquo; section, you should know that I did karate for almost 7 years of my earliest childhood. Contrary to popular belief, it wasn’t merely about fighting, but primarly about athleticism. We did a lot of gymnastics, stretching and so on at the time.
This photos was taken around a half of the year ago when I already did somtehing.
I am still very flexible because of that.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my activity section! Here, I will introduce everything I do as a physical exercise. This includes: football, workout and stretching.
Football Description: My journey with football isn&amp;rsquo;t so straightforward. I started hating it, but ended up loving it. Now it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to wind down and make friendships! By the way, my position is a goalkeeper and favourite club is Manchester United.
In 2019 our team went to Denmark.</description>
