      <description>A Few Words of Explanation If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following my posts, you might have noticed a pattern of increasingly long breaks, especially since the second half of 2023. But a 7-month gap? That’s by far the longest pause yet (my last post, dated here, was that long ago).
Originally, this post was meant to mark my blog’s revival in the fall of 2024. At the time, I had written an opening about my increasingly long breaks—especially the seven-month gap (see above) since my last post.</description>

      <title>CAS - Final Reflection</title>

      <description>Prelude It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to look back on the creation of this portfolio. I remember the days at the Bury Mis camp, waking up early to work on this site in peace. The struggle with understanding Hugo&amp;rsquo;s folder structure, now trivial, was so daunting back then. Even after the summer of 2022, I still hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured out all the inner workings, like how to place pictures side by side. I felt the weight of my promise to finish my CAS portfolio by the start of my junior year, and the pressure was intense.</description>

      <title>Activity. Reflection 17 - Approaching The Splits #6</title>
      <link>https://undemalum.github.io/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits-6/</link>

      <description>Up to speed There&amp;rsquo;s a noticeable gap between this reflection and the previous one, mainly due to the mock exams that consumed much of my time in the past 2-3 weeks. This, coupled with other blog topics and life events, delayed this update.
Before diving into my progress on the splits, I want to clarify a couple of things mentioned in previous posts:
Firstly, the handstand series has been abandoned. I grew tired of explaining its safety and many concerns about potential injuries.</description>

      <guid>https://undemalum.github.io/portfolio/posts/approaching-the-splits-5/</guid>
      <description>In a rush I confess, the only reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this particular reflection is to wrap up this month&amp;rsquo;s activity and dive into creativity and service. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a change of heart about sports—definitely not! It&amp;rsquo;s just that there&amp;rsquo;s not much progress to share, almost nothing if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest. I simply want to get this over with.
The urgency comes from some changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made to the Resource Center and a new charge at Bury Mis that I&amp;rsquo;m excited to talk about.</description>

      <description>Warm up I&amp;rsquo;ve started replacing dump cover pictures of me doing the splits. The exact reasons are not important. But it&amp;rsquo;s not why you&amp;rsquo;re here so let&amp;rsquo;s go straight to the point.
Just one thing&amp;hellip; Pictures in this section were taken during only one stretching section. You now the reason, but I just wanted to let you know. They are representative though, so they should suffice. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s see what&amp;rsquo;s up, at last.</description>

      <title>Activity &amp; Creativity. Reflection 14, 15 - Handstand</title>
      <link>https://undemalum.github.io/portfolio/posts/handstand/</link>

      <guid>https://undemalum.github.io/portfolio/posts/handstand/</guid>
      <description>Reason In the description, I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with handstands. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to learn, and now I&amp;rsquo;m finally giving it a try. While some consider it risky, I disagree. The worst-case scenario is I might go into the bridge position or perform a reverse somersault. So, no need to worry—I&amp;rsquo;ll be just fine.
On another note, I see this as a way to breathe new life into my YouTube channel, which had been inactive for about half a year.</description>

      <description>Intro real quick I have already discussed extensively problems with documenting my progress so I won&amp;rsquo;t be talking about it here. All I want to do here is sum up how much more (hopefully) my muscles have become flexible.
Focus is the key one would argue.
The socks look professional, don&amp;rsquo;t they?
Muscles extension The title is misleading as my muscles are not longer, but can be stretched more. As always, it is not easy to measure how exactly I progressed.</description>

      <description>The need The description may be misleading because I don&amp;rsquo;t mind when it&amp;rsquo;s freezing and, on the contrary, I actually enjoy it. However, I&amp;rsquo;m an exception so a certain level of temperature must be maintained using the fireplace which, in our case, is powered with wood. Unfortunately, the wood comes in big slices that can&amp;rsquo;t quite fit and some adjustments need to be made. This is the reason why I was employed in wood splitting - to make the wood smaller.</description>

      <description>Ridiculousness Normally, I would report something about stretching, a new exercise, or football. However, painting my fence took me so long and exhausted so much that I barely had strength to do anything else. So I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s stopping me from reflecting on this? NOTHING&amp;rdquo; (beside the fact that my brother was the one to whom the task was initially assigned, but he needed some proper motivation it turned out.</description>

The Beatles, &amp;ldquo;Here Comes The Sun&amp;rdquo; Hello world! Although I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call myself a summer lover, I must admit that summer opens up the door for a considerable number of activities that are less available or less pleasant during the rest of the year. In addition, summer means vacation, which, supposedly, translates to a huge amount of free time (unless you&amp;rsquo;re an IB student.</description>

      <description>The Story The story behind this post is simple. Today, we had our last CAS lesson this school year and our dear coordinator wanted us to create a group reflection. We were given (giant) pieces of paper on which learning outcomes were written for us to describe what we did over the year to meet these learning outcomes.
Each of us (the handful that showed up) along with the coordinator wrote a short note, explaining our actions within every learning outcome.</description>

      <description>Excuse On September 28th, 2022, I published my first reflection concerning my adventure with the splits, which is quite some time ago. I have postponed the release of another reflection for a couple of reasons.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s annoying to take photos while stretching because you can&amp;rsquo;t just painlessly stand up (it hurts very badly, believe me) to grab your phone. Without any photos there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence of my progress and with no evidence it&amp;rsquo;s meaningless to even start writing a reflection.</description>

      <description>Video reflection Since it&amp;rsquo;s about my YouTube channel, I decided to make a video reflection. I talk about what&amp;rsquo;s new in term of the &amp;ldquo;Around The World And Further&amp;rdquo; series. I focus mainly on the technical aspect of editing and numbers those videos make, but I also pay much attention to the football progress. Here it is:

Christmas Cards As mentioned in the video, in between performances, we could make Christmas cards for Hospicjum Palium in Poznań. I believe it was a great initiative by the organizers. Besides, I really enjoyed making these cards. Here is a taste of how it looked like:</description>

      <description>Video reflection Since this reflection was also about my Youtube channel, I decided to record me relfecting on what I did and how I felt about it.
First video in series Video below is a game changer in terms of my channel. Although I have already released a longer and more complex video, it it this clip that has changed the course of my channel.
Second video in series By creating the successor of the first video, I aimed to add some more humor and fancy editing magic.</description>

      <description>A glimpse into my work I regularly meet with all my &amp;ldquo;Bears&amp;rdquo;1 from the camp - Piotr, Marcin, and Adam. Since there are three of them, I visit each tri-weekly (usually). This is also due to logistic reasons. They live all across Poznań. Commuting unavoidably consumes much of my time and, although I get to know new places (like a cozy café in Wilda district!) which is fine, sadly I can&amp;rsquo;t pay them visits more often.</description>

      <description>How did I start? I find it worth-mentioning, the beginnings. Why? Because it started when I was &amp;ldquo;pursuing my football dreams&amp;rdquo;. More specifically, when we (my team at that time) had the header exam. To pass, we had to hit the ball with your head 15 times (additional 16th hit was for a higher mark). As simple as that, right? No, if you have never juggled with your head! And this was my case.</description>

      <description>A brief summary Having read the &amp;ldquo;About me&amp;rdquo; section, you should know that I did karate for almost 7 years of my earliest childhood. Contrary to popular belief, it wasn’t merely about fighting, but primarly about athleticism. We did a lot of gymnastics, stretching and so on at the time.
This photos was taken around a half of the year ago when I already did somtehing.
I am still very flexible because of that.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my activity section! Here, I will introduce everything I do as a physical exercise. This includes: football, workout and stretching.
Football Description: My journey with football isn&amp;rsquo;t so straightforward. I started hating it, but ended up loving it. Now it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to wind down and make friendships! By the way, my position is a goalkeeper and favourite club is Manchester United.
In 2019 our team went to Denmark.</description>
