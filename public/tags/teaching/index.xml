      <description>Welcome to my servie section Here, I will present everything I do voluntarily, serving others. This includes: the foundation of Bury Miś, teaching and temporary events.
Bury Miś Description: The foundation of Bury Miś is a charity, aiming to help disabled people - both physically and intelectually. The charity was found in 1983 in Cracow, but moved to Nowy Klincz 9 years later. My contribution here is serving as a counselor during camps organized for the disabled, meeting with my charges throughout the year and occasionally selling hand-made Kashubian chesse.</description>
