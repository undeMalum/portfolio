# Portfolio
Hi! This repository hosts the source "code" of my website where I report on my day-to-day life and showcase my projects. I do not expect other people to contribute (although if you have a suggestion I'm happy to listen), but I leave this repository open for others to learn. When I was creating my blog, I used [this repository](https://github.com/Nereuxofficial/nereuxofficial.github.io) by [Nereuxofficial](https://github.com/Nereuxofficial) for inspiration.
